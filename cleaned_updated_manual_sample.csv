Who are you?,efood Marketing team,"efood Marketing team are the Marketing team of efood, a popular online food delivery platform in Greece, and in this book, efood Marketing team share our operational transformation journey and the way efood Marketing team work. For the past four and a half years, efood Marketing team have changed our way of thinking and working, efood Marketing team have experimented with a couple of available frameworks, and developed a method of working by mixing and matching processes that made sense to our team and business context."
What is this about?,Its a handbook about Agile Marketing,"This handbook is not about teaching you Agile or Lean methodologies. You can find coaches and Agile professionals with plenty of experience and in-depth knowledge to help you understand and implement the core concepts. These methodologies are easily learned and understood, but they are still difficult to implement and master. Agile methods haven’t been designed with the Marketing industry in mind; efood Marketing team learned that the hard way. Hence, a modern Marketing team that wants to adopt the approach presented in this book should first consider its use seriously and then try to use it with its (many) pros and cons since this specific method was born and implemented by a Marketing team."
Why this and not an established framework like Scrum?,We dont want to reinvent the wheel but Nero is more useful,"Most of the techniques that you will encounter in this book are not new, but they are not widespread in the marketing landscape. efood Marketing team do not want to reinvent the wheel. efood Marketing team have been experimenting throughout the years, so our system now is more like a mix and match model consisting of techniques from many popular frameworks, adjusted to marketing needs."
Who should read this book?,marketing professionals that work in “traditional” marketing teams or big corporations with a strict marketing structure.,"The whole concept was written with two different marketing personas in mind. The first group consists of marketing professionals that work in “traditional” marketing teams or big corporations with a strict marketing structure. In this book, a different and more efficient way to work and collaborate will be introduced. By being more flexible with the processes you have established, you can efficiently cope with changes in your environment and the industry you work with, without compromising the desired brand safety and performance."
Why they should read the book?,To read about a more efficient way to work and collaborate.,"a different and more efficient way to work and collaborate will be introduced. By being more flexible with the processes you have established, you can efficiently cope with changes in your environment and the industry you work with, without compromising the desired brand safety and performance."
Who should read this book?,modern marketers  working at full speed,"The second group is the group of modern marketers that are not aware of traditional bureaucratic processes, something that can be considered as an advantage. While working at full speed, most of the time, you tend to create anarchy and work until you burn out (we experienced burnout syndromes before Nero as well). This book can be your guide for setting lightweight but mandatory processes and maintaining your fast pace without producing projects and campaigns in a random way."
Why they should read the book?,its a guide for setting lightweight but mandatory processes,"This book can be your guide for setting lightweight but mandatory processes and maintaining your fast pace without producing projects and campaigns in a random way. When efood Marketing team started, efood Marketing team were definitely in the second group. However, our company and our department evolved and grew. Currently, being a group of big marketing teams, efood Marketing team are trying to keep most of the pros that efood Marketing team had as a small team."
Is this book direct us to heaven?,No it won't," Please do not assume that once you read and implement the techniques from this book, you will be taken to “Marketing heaven” where everything flows seamlessly, and everyone is happy. No. What this book will do is help you build a prospering environment that works well, generates great business and marketing performance, and cultivates fruitful interpersonal relationships."
Why Marketing should become agile?,Due to marketing landscape complexity,"Agile methodologies have been devised to handle complex IT projects effectively and in time. In the mid-nineties, IT departments realized that if they were to tackle complexity well, they needed to set up processes different from the traditional waterfall methods*. Nowadays, the marketing landscape faces the same problem with the same root cause. Complexity."
Give me an example of marketing complexity,advanced online remarketing campaigns or advanced technical SEO,"Before the digital revolution, marketing ads and activities were handled mostly manually and offline. Promoting a product on the radio or in magazines was a straightforward process between marketers, who used to strictly follow the initial project specs, with distinct steps that were time-consuming and not easily adapted to the emerging needs or changes. With the emergence of digital marketing, in order to create an online campaign, marketers needed to add targeting options and budget parameters in digital platforms, set up tracking concepts, experiment with bidding strategies, test multiple creatives and copy, and monitor the performance. There are modern marketing verticals, such as remarketing campaigns or advanced technical SEO that even tech-savvy professionals are struggling to excel at mostly due to their technical complexity. Agile methodologies can help marketers to better handle and implement complex tasks doing the mandatory iterations, as well as make rapid changes, according to performance or potential business changes."
Why Marketing should become agile?,increased advertising competition is a thing currently,"Removing complexity from the equation, efood Marketing team observe that digital channels provide low-cost, effective targeted ads compared to traditional offline marketing channels - a fact that adds another layer of difficulty; increased advertising competition. However, one problem that has emerged is a noisy digital environment for users who see multiple ads within the day. Agile methodologies can help marketers to stand-out from their competition by allowing them to complete iterations faster (audience tests, bidding tests, creative tests, etc.) and implement winning changes on the fly without a ton of permissions and signatures. As a test, try to identify how many digital ads you see each day and you will realize the level of competition that a business faces."
Why advertising competition increased?,Because digital advertising that is emerging is cheaper to traditional,"Digital advertising is a cheap promotion option compared to offline ads. If you compare the cost of a billboard ad with that of a Facebook ad, you will realize that they are not comparable at all. Even the smallest startup can utilize the power of mass advertising platforms and get the best results with the lowest cost."
Why Marketing should become Agile?,Speed is the ultimate trait of a team,"If there is one word that describes modern marketing, then that is speed. Due to technological changes, the marketing landscape is changing every day, and you need to be constantly aware of and adjust your techniques according to the latest best practices. Speed is one of the most critical elements of every team and company that wants to excel in a landscape that is full of complexity, competition, and heavy (or no) processes. Although speed and process are considered to be contradictory notions, this process is an attempt to create a “speed-friendly” framework tailored to marketing needs."
Provide an example of real time marketing,Oreo campaign in Super Bowl 2013,"Back in 2013, Oreo “broke” the marketing landscape and highlighted the necessity of real-time marketing for every business that wants to become and stay relevant to its audience. During the third quarter of that year’s Super Bowl (one of the most significant events in the US), a power outage caused a partial blackout for half an hour. Oreo responded quickly to this incident by creating the “Power Out? No problem” online advertisement about the blackout, which created great engagement, without the company having paid for a spot or sponsorship for the Super Bowl. This action not only requires agility but creativity as well, and it’s equally impressive in terms of how strategy and operational effectiveness can lead to great examples."
How you became agile?,"Our journey into the Agile and Scrum world started in 2015. Before that, efood Marketing team had no structured process.","Our journey into the Agile world started in 2015. Before that, efood Marketing team had no structured process. There were always glimpses of organizing and planning our tasks, but most of the decisions were based on analyses that efood Marketing team did on the spot and user feedback. efood Marketing team decided that efood Marketing team have to explore other ways of working in order to organize ourselves and orchestrate our projects and roadmaps better. efood Marketing team hired Yannis, a reputable Agile coach, to help us implement Scrum, which is a popular Agile working process. Yannis informed us that Scrum was designed to handle complex IT projects, and his concern was that it would be challenging to implement within a marketing team, but our small size (back then there were six of us) and our willingness for commitment, convinced him to proceed and start our collaboration."
How you implemented Scrum?,We decided to implement Scrum one step at a time,"We decided to implement Scrum one step at a time and reach 100% Scrum implementation within three months. The experiment worked, and efood Marketing team followed the Scrum framework for almost a year. As efood Marketing team reached the tipping point and started to scale both as a team and as a company, the first major problems emerged. "
Describe the initial problems you faced,Some of Scrum rituals were unproductive,"Some of the Scrum meetings and processes were unproductive, and the amount of time efood Marketing team consumed on our Agile “duties” increased exponentially but returned little value. So two years ago, efood Marketing team faced a dilemma: efood Marketing team would either keep the official type of Scrum but not follow it (since it was impossible to do so) or change it and adjust it to our own needs."
How did you solve the initial problems?,"Switch from Scrum to Scrum Nexus and eventually our own framework, Nero.","After all, the best-case scenario was that efood Marketing team would solve our problems successfully, while the worst case was that efood Marketing team would learn something new. efood Marketing team mapped all our current issues and potential future problems, and -along with Yannis’ help- efood Marketing team switched from Scrum to Scrum Nexus, which became the foundation of our own custom process. efood Marketing team divided our department into three teams so that efood Marketing team could better handle our tasks and that had worked for two years with outstanding results in terms of effectiveness."
Why you switched from Scrum Nexus to Nero?,"Due to major alignment issues between sub-teams, especially in handling dependencies.","But then, another major problem emerged. Due to our big scale, efood Marketing team faced major alignment issues between sub-teams, especially in handling dependencies. Many tasks were blocked due to different priorities between teams that led us to re-evaluate our process. So that was it, after four years of iterations, efood Marketing team came up with “Nero” our custom framework. The approach was not to reinvent the wheel but learn from our mistakes and our problems, borrow parts from popular Lean and Agile processes that could be applied to our day-to-day struggles and create a model that would fit our needs."
Did Nero worked for your team?,Team grow effectively,"- Our team grew a lot. efood Marketing team started as six people, and now efood Marketing team are more than 20. efood Marketing team are separated into two sub-teams that consist of performance marketers, event managers, copywriters, videographers, community managers, etc."
Did Nero worked for your team?,Marketing and business performance grew exponentially,"- Marketing and business performance grew exponentially. While efood Marketing team were iterating on our working process, efood Marketing team delivered business value and revenue, consistently hitting our targets with acceptable costs. When efood Marketing team started, efood Marketing team were among the top three online delivery marketplaces. Now, the competition has increased, but efood Marketing team are leading the market."
Did Nero worked for your team?,achieved a team happiness score of 80%,"- This year efood Marketing team achieved a team happiness score of 80% for the way efood Marketing team work, which means that our team truly likes the way efood Marketing team work."
Did Nero worked for your team?,process is considered as the “best practice” within the online delivery industry,- Our process is considered as the “best practice” within the online delivery industry across many countries.
Did Nero worked for your team?,"Turnover rate is more than four years,","- Turnover rate is more than four years, a healthy indicator for a relatively new company in a brand new industry (online food delivery industry is about six years old in our country)."
What should I consider before I try to implement an Agile framework?,need to believe in Agile before you start,"First, you, your team and your business need to believe in Agile before you start. You will realize soon enough that you need to apply some changes that are not easy, and if you are not 100% committed to it, you won’t be able to transform your current processes into better ones. There will be hard times, especially in the early days, since every new process needs time for adoption. You don’t have to be fully committed to Scrum or Kanban or any other Agile methodology. You need to stay committed to your willingness to change the way you are currently working and explore new ways that will help you achieve operational effectiveness. efood Marketing team liked the way efood Marketing team worked in the past. efood Marketing team were used to it. efood Marketing team could solve our problems even with a waterfall process, simply because this was the way efood Marketing team grew as professionals. But efood Marketing team believed that trying a new different way would help us become even better, and that is the right approach to embrace Agile."
What should I consider before I try to implement an Agile framework?,treat yourself and the whole team like a machine,"Secondly, you need to treat yourself and the whole team like a machine.Every problem or conflict that emerges is an excellent way to provide a hands-on solution to each specific problem and adjust your “machine” in a way that will better handle similar issues in the future. Don’t do random things and don’t just copy what other teams or companies are doing, only to have a method in place.Invest in your process, change it when change is mandatory, don’t do a ton of changes simultaneously, build metrics to measure its efficiency and encourage constant and honest feedback among your team members because they are the most vital part of your machine. And please, don’t invest in Agile because it’s a fancy term, become Agile because you deserve to work in a better way. Moreover, please note that Agile (like growth) is not a job description. You should not hire a person to implement an Agile framework. You can hire a consultant to guide you, but after all, it’s a team activity. Everyone should invest time and effort because everyone will be affected by the outcome."
What should I consider before I try to implement an Agile framework?,do not confuse process effectiveness with strategy,"Lastly, please, please do not confuse process effectiveness with strategy. Implementing the ideal working process will definitely help you build a better business, but it won’t solve all your problems. According to Peter Drucker, operational effectiveness is necessary but not sufficient, while the essence of strategy is choosing to perform activities differently than rivals do."
Should I hire an Agile coach?,"is a nice way to take your Agile transformation seriously, yes.","Hiring a coach is a nice way to take your Agile transformation seriously and make sure that you are willing to invest both money and time to implement it right. efood Marketing team collaborated with the founder of Agile Summit in Greece, Mr. Yannis Mavraganis, a passionate aficionado of Agile with plenty of coaching experience. This was a new experiment for him as well, because, as he says, efood Marketing team are the first non-IT team who approached him."
Why we need Agile coach?,Scrum framework is simple to explain but difficult to master,"The Scrum framework is simple to explain. Doing a six-hour workshop can help you cover all of its elements and understand how it works and identify the best way of implementation. However, as efood Marketing team said before, efood Marketing team didn’t just want to do Agile. efood Marketing team wished to shape an ‘Agile’ mentality that would optimize our workflow and transform us into a world-class marketing team. Having Yannis with us on regular activities was the key to our Agile adoption. Together efood Marketing team could identify what works best for us and what efood Marketing team should change to optimize our efficiency. An effective coach can “validate” the changes to ensure efood Marketing team were in the right direction, following the Agile principles and values and not doing a waterfall workflow camouflaged in Scrum ;). This is important because Scrum is based on empiricism and has some vague definitions that, without the help of an expert, form different opinions that can lead to conflicts across team members."
Why we need Agile coach?,coach should always promote consistency and discipline,"As every marketing team should do, efood Marketing team started with passion and positive vibes. However, our vibrant routine did not help us in being consistent. A good Agile coach should always encourage the team and keep consistency and discipline levels high. Consistency was our primary challenge, and the only way to defeat it was to form a specific habit (we’ll discuss that later on)."
Why we need Agile coach?,coach can provide in-depth domain knowledge and assure that you’re in the right direction,"To sum up, an efficient coach can provide in-depth domain knowledge and assure that you’re in the right direction. The authority will help decrease conflicts and increase unity across the team and orchestrate the whole implementation process, so that the team can have a smooth and successful adoption of an Agile working process. Just a tip here, avoid dogmatic coaches since they won’t be so flexible in other working frameworks except for the ones they already like, and since there is no popular successful implementation in Marketing, you will end up following IT or an other industry’s processes (just like Scrum) which are very good but not optimal for Marketing."
"Provide me a ""doing"" agile example",team believed that religiously following the rules would take us to the next level.,"After setting up our Scrum, efood Marketing team solely focused on how to follow the process and how efood Marketing team could solve our problems based on Agile theory. efood Marketing team had long conversations with our Agile coach on how to write better user tasks, how to shape our internal structure, and how events should be organized. efood Marketing team believed that religiously following the rules would take us to the next level."
What is a mistake that team did in the early days?,focus on the process is one of the biggest mistakes team ever made.,Our focus on the process is one of the biggest mistakes efood Marketing team have ever made.
"Provide me a ""doing"" agile example","We change our working process to comply with Scrum rules, and that’s it, efood Marketing team become Agile","“Doing Agile” is the approach that many organizations follow: ”We change our working process to comply with Scrum rules, and that’s it, efood Marketing team become Agile.” However, it’s not that simple. The Scrum guide is 16 pages long, anyone can read it and follow its rules, but that doesn’t make you and your team Agile. Across the globe, thousands of companies use Agile methodologies. So, when it comes to best practices, our primary references are Spotify and Toyota (for lean methods). If almost everyone is using Agile methodologies and Scrum is simple to understand, then why is it difficult to master it?"
Why being Agile is different thatn doing Agile?,Being Agile includes several business elements rather than your working process,"We believe that “doing Agile” is different from “being Agile.” Being Agile includes several business elements rather than your working process. You don’t just have to follow the rules of Scrum. You need to change the way you think and the way you work. Through those years, efood Marketing team understood that the “art” of the process is to realize where you need process and where you don’t, so you can keep only the processes that matter and remove the unnecessary ones. Removing processes is more difficult than creating new ones."

Why doing Agile is wrong?,We focused on the wrong thing to improve,"We had lengthy discussions on how efood Marketing team should implement velocity estimations (rather than time estimations), while still having a top to bottom management structure. efood Marketing team cared a lot about keeping the events time-boxed, but efood Marketing team didn’t motivate our team to iterate more. efood Marketing team argued about having one-week or two-week sprints, while efood Marketing team were consumed by the urgency of our projects rather than their value. efood Marketing team preached about multiple iterations, while sometimes our project roadmap was so tight and strict that iterations would take months to implement. Konstantinos once read a great comment in an Agile forum that said: It is just frustrating to see managers “trying to do Agile” that treat their people like “computers” and expect that “Agile OS” will be installed just a couple of days after the workshop."

Give me a comparable example of process,Having the best football shoes does not make you a great football player,"Your working process is like a tool. Having the best football shoes does not make you a great football player. Other critical elements define your success, such as the team you’re playing in, the quality of your practice, even your opponents. efood Marketing team believe the same happens with Agile. The working process is not enough. Other critical aspects define your team’s agility and should be embraced as well. To be honest, most of them were already in place, but documenting and highlighting them helped us to instil them into our hiring process in order to make sure that future colleagues would share the same mindset and values with us. In the next pages, efood Marketing team will briefly describe those elements; if you are interested only in our methodology, you can skip the next chapter and read “Agile Marketing: Nero.”"
"Why is it difficult to ""being Agile""","You can obtain technical SEO skills, but there is no course to teach you how to care.","After numerous discussions with other marketers and industry professionals, efood Marketing team realized that in most cases, these aspects are way more difficult to be changed. They are difficult to change because changes affect the whole business, not just marketing departments. Also, some of them do not have a linear path. You can obtain technical SEO skills by doing an online marketing course, but there is no path to teach you how to care about your company. Of course, this does not apply to every business or marketing department, but Konstantinos recommend you check our learnings and take them into consideration before you proceed with your Agile transformation."
Give me a tip for food of thought,team can’t fixate on a new process and believe that it will work from day one.,"Humans have existed for over 200,000 years. The civilization, as efood Marketing team know it, is only about 6,000 years old, and industrialization started only in the 18th century. Everything happened evolutionarily, and that is something that efood Marketing team should have in mind before efood Marketing team implement a new working process. efood Marketing team can’t fixate on a new process and believe that it will work from day one."
What is a differentiator of teams?,Our only differentiator from businesses within the industry is our people and our culture,"Our only differentiator from businesses within the same industry is our people and our culture. Let me elaborate on this. efood Marketing team are an online food delivery platform that allows users to order food from their favorite restaurants digitally. Our competition has more or less the same restaurants, they use the same advertising platforms, and efood Marketing team share a lot of common product features. Besides technical and communicational skills that every regular professional in the marketing industry should have, our team members share a common trait. Junior professionals, marketing gurus, copywriters, performance marketers, they all have that trait. They care about the company. It may sound vague or common or even stupid to someone, but for us, it’s a big deal."
Should an employee care about the company?,Yes definitely,You need to care to change the already established way of working.
Why you should care about the company?,to change the already established way of working.,You need to care to change the already established way of working.
Why you should care about the company?,to invest time and effort into something that is not part of your job description,"You need to care to invest time and effort into something that is not part of your job description; as in this case, the whole team is responsible for the implementation of Agile, not just the Scrum master."
Why you should care about the company?,to become a valuable team member rather than a cog in a machine.,You need to care to become a valuable team member rather than a cog in a machine.
Why you should care about the company?,evolve your skills; you will just do what you are asked for.,"If you don’t care enough, you won’t evolve your skills; you will just do what you are asked for."
Why you should care about the company?,To do one more job interview that may lead you to hire an exceptional employee.,"If you don’t care, you won’t do that one more job interview that may lead you to hire an exceptional employee."
Why you should care about the company?,To check that one user review that is negative and may lead you to make changes that you don’t want to.,"If you don’t care, you won’t check that one user review that is negative and may lead you to make changes that you don’t want to."
Why you should care about the company?,to sit back and spend time on efficient planning rather than completing task lists.,You need to care to sit back and spend time on efficient planning rather than completing task lists.
Why you should care about the company?,to provide honest feedback to your teammates,"You need to care to provide honest feedback to your teammates that may lead to short-term unhappiness, but in the long-term, it will pay off."
Why you should care about the company?,to stand against a project,"You need to care to stand against a project that, although it will generate revenue, it will have a negative impact on user experience."
Why you should care about the company?,to stay longer in the office,"You need to care to stay longer in the office to do something that no one has asked for, but you believe it is the right thing to do."
Why you should care about the company?,to understand how the whole business is operating and not just promote Marketing actions.,You need to care to understand how the whole business is operating and not just promote Marketing actions.
What happens if you don't care?,it is very difficult to have empathy.,"If you don’t care, it is very difficult to have empathy."
What happens if you don't care?,it is very difficult to work autonomously and create your own tasks.,"If you don’t care, it is very difficult to work autonomously and create your own tasks."
What happens if you don't care?,you won’t be able to create big projects on your own,"If you don’t care, you won’t be able to create big projects on your own, because big projects require extensive analysis, collaboration with many people, good business understanding and willingness to fight for your project against other projects. Plus, they might fail, and you need to live with it and move to the next project."
What happens if you don't care?,you won’t go the extra mile,"If you don’t care, you won’t go the extra mile, and you will just “serve” a stakeholders’ request rather than “own” it."
What is your opinion about autonomy?,team believe that everyone likes autonomy,"efood Marketing team believe that everyone likes autonomy. efood Marketing team approach autonomy both as a team and as individuals. Ideally, all existing projects should be 100% attainable by our own resources. Working on something end-to-end enhances the feeling of accountability across team members since they are solely responsible for both the implementation quality and business outcome. That’s why efood Marketing team did not form our teams strictly by specialty but in a blended way so that every team can operate autonomously. The Growth team has a copywriter that focuses on ad copy, while the Retention team has performance marketers that optimize engagement metrics."
Give me a good example of autonomy,performance marketers are responsible for making the analysis and evaluation of the marketing channels,"Although efood Marketing team have a great Business Intelligence team within our company, performance marketers are responsible for making the analysis and evaluation of the marketing channels. Let’s take Facebook reporting, for example. A business analyst would be interested in creating an overview report for impressions, clicks, conversions, CPC, CPM and CPV accompanied by channel’s ROI (return on investment) but we, as performance marketers, love to make deep dives in channel’s data trying to find optimization opportunities within devices and placements performance, identify correlations between an image ad and a video ad or understand how relevance score can affect the CPC and ROI. All the above need time and expertise (that a business analyst may not have) and need to be done multiple times within a month because campaign optimization is an iterative process. Through this process, efood Marketing team were able to identify the pattern of “ad fatigue” within our campaigns and solve it before it creates a big performance problem."
Give me a good example of autonomy,"people need to create the specifications of the project, not just follow the rules that someone else created.","Also, having experts to execute tasks that someone else proposed, created specs for, and defined success metrics is quite an oxymoron. Individual autonomy promotes a culture of improvisation because people need to create the specifications of the project, not just follow the rules that someone else created."
Encourage Autonomy,"Some time ago, efood Marketing","Some time ago, efood Marketing team had a project about performance benchmarking of a specific marketing channel, which means that efood Marketing team needed to find a way to validate the data that the channel provided us with. When it comes to data validation methods, there are a couple of techniques such as A/A tests or test traffic data, etc. efood Marketing team came up with an unconventional but unique idea, “The Blank Test.”, according to which, efood Marketing team created a campaign with “empty” banners (plain white images) and compared it with a campaign of branded banners to understand how branded banners affect a specific metric. The results were surprising because the performance of the “blank banner” campaign was better than the performance of the branded campaign, which led us to stop our advertising efforts and remove the platform from our performance marketing mix."
Give me a quote,It does not make sense to hire chess players and then treat them like chess pieces,"It does not make sense to hire chess players and then treat them like chess pieces. Autonomy is an Agile principle as well, and efood Marketing team are trying to adopt it in the following areas:"
What is the blank test,team created a campaign with “empty” banners (plain white images) and compared it with a campaign of branded banners,"Some time ago, efood Marketing team had a project about performance benchmarking of a specific marketing channel, which means that efood Marketing team needed to find a way to validate the data that the channel provided us with.

Give me a good example of ownership,90% of our marketing activities are executed in-house,"More than 90% of our marketing activities are executed in-house. External dependencies is a major problem of many teams because the more dependencies you have, the less efficient your planning is, you can't do iterations fast enough, and you need more meetings simply because professionals that are not in the company need more time to understand what you want to achieve and how to execute a project successfully."
Give me a good example of ownership,In 2019 our most successful campaign was the “1+1 deals,"In 2019 our most successful campaign was the “1+1 deals”. This campaign was a national campaign in which restaurants participated with attractive offers across all cities and all cuisines. This was a very complex campaign that needed the incorporation of multiple departments (finance, sales, marketing, business intelligence, product, tech, etc.) to be successful. Hadn’t most of the marketing activities been in-house this campaign would not have been feasible within a reasonable time period, and the opportunity would have been wasted."
Why autonomy is difficult?,Autonomy is not the norm in a big company,"Let me be clear with that. Not only did efood Marketing team have C-level approval to be an autonomous team, but efood Marketing team had also earned it. Autonomy is not the norm in a big company and you have to be as responsible and efficient as possible in your job in order to maintain it."
Give me a good example of ownership,team trying to achieve a similar state to “one-piece flow”,"Being heavily influenced by the book Toyota Way efood Marketing team decided to bring all Marketing activities in-house (except for one) trying to achieve a similar state to “one-piece flow” that Toyota has. Imagine that you want to create a digital campaign, and you have a design agency (for banners), a performance agency (for campaign setup and optimization), a creative agency (for copy and videos), and an  in-house marketing manager who has to coordinate with everyone. Now add about five iterations that the campaign will need to deliver optimized results, and you will have a perfect case study of a disaster. Now imagine you have an in-house team that consists of a designer, a copywriter, a performance marketer, and a manager. Try to calculate the estimated delivery time of the examples above, and you will see a significant difference between time cost.
FYI: The only activity efood Marketing team outsource is TV commercials due to the low TV commercial production cadence efood Marketing team have (we produce two commercials per year, so there is no reason to have an in-house team)."
Give me a good example of ownership,"There is no penalty if you reach the office half an hour late, and there is no penalty if you leave half an hour earlier than the official schedule."," If you think that your team is fully productive, 40 hours/week, 52 weeks/year, you are wrong, even if your time tracking tools insist on that!
We, as individuals, decide how much time efood Marketing team will allocate to projects during our sprint. Since the team does the actual work, they know how much time they need to accomplish it. There is no penalty if you reach the office half an hour late, and there is no penalty if you leave half an hour earlier than the official schedule. By the end of each sprint, efood Marketing team do not measure “productive” hours. efood Marketing team measure marketing performance and deliverable volume and quality. After all, as professionals, efood Marketing team are evaluated by the work and the value efood Marketing team deliver, not by the hours efood Marketing team work. Nero master helps everyone do the best planning for the sprint, minimizing “waste” between productive and working hours."
Give me a good example of ownership,not strict hierarchy," efood Marketing team will not say that efood Marketing team don’t have a hierarchy. efood Marketing team do, but it is not strict. All team managers follow a servant-leader approach, and they mostly help teams stay aligned with our core strategy and other teams’ requests. Most of our teams’ decisions come from team members, along with managers. This approach is called “bottom-up,” and for it to be successful, you need a strong vision and a clear-cut strategy to avoid conflicts and projects that may lead to wrong directions. One thing that helped us a lot is that all managers are hands-on professionals, so they know 100% how the job should be done effectively."
Give me a quote,"Need, Must, Can’t, Only, Just, Fast, ASAP are forbidden words in the office","When efood Marketing team started Nero, efood Marketing team made a deal. DO NOT USE THE FOLLOWING WORDS AGAIN: Need, Must, Can’t, Only, Just, Fast, ASAP, It will only take 1 minute"
What is a healthy business enviroment?,A healthy business environment is the best place to work at,"A healthy business environment is the best place to work at. By “healthy” efood Marketing team mean a couple of working conditions that are user-friendly and encourage people to work better and be more productive. Also, efood Marketing team need to make sure that “healthy” does not mean “complacent,” which is equally worse to “toxic.” An interesting approach that helped us create that kind of environment is to avoid toxic situations at all costs. There are a lot of reasons why efood Marketing team become toxic; efood Marketing team identified them and worked on eliminating them."

Give me a tip for a healthy working enviroment,Being rude is toxic.,"Being rude is toxic. When someone expressed his or her opinion, there were times that this opinion was completely off-topic, and some members (including me) reacted badly. Given that efood Marketing team had known each other for years, this reaction was sometimes insulting. The reason that Konstantinos reacted like this is that after all the discussions that efood Marketing team had had for a specific concept, it made no sense for someone to have that specific kind of opinion. In one of our retrospective meetings, efood Marketing team discussed it, and Konstantinos realized that there are times when people do not fully understand the whole concept, but they are reluctant to ask for further explanation due to limited time and prior negative reactions. efood Marketing team solved that by making sure that everyone fully understands the concepts that efood Marketing team discuss and efood Marketing team also embraced a “no judging” policy by which no member is allowed to be rude both at the first time or the next time it happens. Konstantinos would like to add here that “no judging policy” does not mean that efood Marketing team accept all projects; it means that efood Marketing team provide honest feedback without insulting anyone."
Give me a tip for a healthy working enviroment,Pushing people to the limits for no reason is toxic,"Pushing people to the limits for no reason is toxic. efood Marketing team know our numbers, efood Marketing team know when efood Marketing team lack performance or when efood Marketing team must try harder. There is no reason for pushing people who already know they must try harder. efood Marketing team know when the deadline of the project approaches (because most of the times efood Marketing team set the deadlines), and what efood Marketing team need to do to deliver it both in time and in the best quality. Treat people with care, and they will respond positively. This is highly correlated with autonomy, as well."
Give me a tip for a healthy working enviroment,internal promotions should not be an empty promise,"In a healthy working environment, people should be able to change positions, and internal promotions should not be an empty promise. If someone feels that he/she has accomplished everything in his/her current position, give them a chance to change even when they are not specialists in this new role. The knowledge they have from their past position is indispensable, and the learning gap will be the smallest possible. Plus, you keep an experienced professional within the company, and you invest in them. efood Marketing team have many examples of employees who changed positions or have been promoted, and efood Marketing team are happy about it."
Why healthy working environment matters?,"one of the main reasons behind loyalty,","Working in a healthy environment was one of the main reasons behind loyalty, according to the team. Loyalty is mandatory to build an efficient system. If your team members are changing all the time, there will be no time for the right onboarding, and there will be no interest in further optimization of the working process, which is reasonable."
What is your main framework for growth?,"Read, Learn, Test, Validate, Repeat","This is the main approach efood Marketing team use to work for performance marketing campaigns. It is a repeatable, non-bureaucratic (very important) data-driven process that can scale across all marketing channels (even those that are not performance-based) and helps us build on projects that deliver value. It is a popular method across modern marketing and growth hacking teams. This core concept of “Growth Engine” has been introduced by Brian Balfour."

"What ""read"" means in the growth framework?",“Read” means that you have to check your data,"This is the first and most important step in the process. “Read” means that you have to check your data. In order to become user-centric, efood Marketing team worked hard and managed to build a foundation of user metrics and user feedback so that efood Marketing team could avoid our own personal and professional biases and focus solely on our user's needs. This was a decision that efood Marketing team made firstly as a business and secondly as a department and took months before it started working efficiently. efood Marketing team have a couple of sophisticated systems in place enabling us to have a comprehensive view of the impact of our efforts.

What data driven means?,You understand which metric is relevant for each project,"You understand which metric is relevant for each project. Not all campaigns generate immediate conversions, and you need to be aware of that before you implement a campaign."
What data driven means?,You understand the business and its core metrics,You understand the business and its core metrics. Even if you are a brand marketer you need to know that YouTube views are not equal to conversions while cost per acquisition (CPA) matters for both branding and performance campaigns.
What data driven means?,Understand that you cant measure everything,"You can’t measure everything. Some projects can’t be measured, and even if you can somehow measure them, the metrics will be biased or not accurate. There is a massive trend of “measuring everything” in the business, but for us, that’s not the case, especially in offline and content marketing.  For example, efood Marketing team can’t measure the business impact of a Facebook like, at least in our industry. efood Marketing team can’t measure the impact of our participation in a marketing meetup of 20 people. efood Marketing team can’t measure the impact of our CSR campaigns in our business performance."
What data driven means?,understand how data is gathered and processed.,"Another issue is that you need to understand how data is gathered and processed. If you do not know how sessions work, what marketing attribution is, how Google Analytics processes hits, session, and user-level data, then you lack basic knowledge, and you are leaving insights and money on the table. efood Marketing team solved that by encouraging (politely forcing actually) everyone involved in the analysis to acquire the Google Analytics certification. Having everyone on the same page reduces the friction of analysis “translation” and enhances the feedback loop for every analysis regardless of the channel since Google Analytics data can act as the single source of truth."
What data driven means?,Know what occams razor is,"Moreover, efood Marketing team always face the problem of “how much is too much”, which is similar to Occam’s Razor principle. A generic conversion rate is a useful and simple metric to monitor, but it hides painful areas that have a relatively low conversion rate. For example, you may have had a 30% conversion rate yesterday but if you wanted to understand how this metric was calculated you would realize that;"
Provide me a segmentation example,campaigns per marketing channel,"Your non-brand campaigns had a 5% conversion rate, Your new visitor campaigns had a 2% conversion rate, Your direct visits had a 50% conversion rate, All the above combined is the 30% conversion rate that you see in your overview dashboards. Checking only top-level metrics is misleading, and you may miss potential opportunities and threats that lie within segments. To solve this one, efood Marketing team defined the meaningful dimensions and the level of depth that efood Marketing team need to check for our business and decided not to segment further than those dimensions. There are about 500 data points to check, which is a big number, but it is relatively small compared to the whole set of data points available."
Give me an example of being data driven,Build an anomaly detection tool for your data,"Lately, efood Marketing team have decided to build an anomaly detection tool. Instead of visiting our analytics platform and checking our dashboards, efood Marketing team created an automated tool that works like this: Firstly, every 4 hours, it collects all data points that efood Marketing team are interested in -both qualitative and quantitative data- and creates a data table. Then efood Marketing team use machine learning algorithms and statistical regression methods to calculate and forecast the right value for each data point according to one-year past performance. So after that, efood Marketing team have two tables of data, one with the actual ones and one with the forecasted. The tool compares those data, and whenever there is a big difference between actual data and forecasted data, efood Marketing team get a Slack notification that informs us about this specific anomaly. This tool is handy and allows us to expand our knowledge and check for insights that efood Marketing team couldn’t have identified by doing the same analysis manually."
Give me an example of being data driven,Switch our name from e-food to efood,"Being data-driven is not a privilege only of performance marketers. Lately, efood Marketing team have taken a big rebranding initiative by changing our logo and our brand name from “e-food” to “efood”. This rebranding was part of our strategic plan, and efood Marketing team did it for a lot of reasons, but one of them was that efood Marketing team identified that this specific keyword (“efood”) had a good performance and positive trend in comparison to our current name (“e-food”) in our search engine marketing results."
What is the second step in Balfour's growth engine?,Second step is learn or understanding the problem/opportunity,"This is the second step and it can be translated as “understanding the problem/opportunity.” This step needs creativity, observation, and anticipation. Once efood Marketing team have “read” the insights, efood Marketing team need to understand what happened and plan our next steps accordingly. efood Marketing team know how users came to our product (thanks to analytics), where they landed, and what pages they navigated along with their exit pages, but efood Marketing team are missing something. efood Marketing team are missing the why."
"What ""learn"" requires?",requires understanding the context for each specific occasion,Understanding the why requires understanding the context for each specific occasion. This is tricky because not every incident is 100% marketing related. This is something that occurs in most of the marketplace businesses due to the nature of the industry. Here are some examples:
Give me an example of understangin the context,an attractive offer promotion from a specific burger restaurant,"Here is the case of a project for which efood Marketing team had to promote an attractive offer from a specific burger restaurant (15% of our total burger sales). efood Marketing team strongly promoted that offer, but it ended up having poor performance. efood Marketing team tried to replicate the flow on our product, and efood Marketing team found a problem: The offer was a €5 burger deal while the restaurant had a €7 minimum order value, so users were not able to order this deal solely, but had to order more to validate the minimum order value. So the offer was great, but efood Marketing team did not take care of the whole user journey before closing the deal and launching the campaign."
Give me an example of understangin the context,a very successful promotional campaign team launched with a specific restaurant chain,"Another example is a very successful promotional campaign efood Marketing team launched with a specific restaurant chain. efood Marketing team created and promoted very attractive food deals with 40 restaurants of a particular chain for ten days. During the campaign, efood Marketing team identified that performance dropped unexpectedly in irregular hours within the day for no specific reason. efood Marketing team checked the user reviews, efood Marketing team checked the conversion of the restaurant pages, and everything was okay. After hours of checking, efood Marketing team found out that some of the restaurants turned off their applications within the day because they couldn’t handle the order volume. Sometimes they turned it off for half an hour and sometimes for a couple of hours. This was very difficult to monitor because efood Marketing team have more than six thousand restaurants and multiple offers that are promoted simultaneously. efood Marketing team found the problem after checking what users had written in the live chat feature that efood Marketing team have on our platform. There were three users mentioning it."
Give me some data,more than five hundred live chat logs per day., team have more than five hundred live chat logs per day.
Give me an example of understangin the context,affected the URLs that efood Marketing team used in our campaigns,"Here is another interesting example when the performance of a bunch of campaigns dropped significantly without having made any change in campaign settings. efood Marketing team did a deep dive into the performance of our campaigns, but efood Marketing team did not find anything that could explain such a significant drop. After that, efood Marketing team collaborated with the Product team to check if something had changed, but still, there was no significant change made. Not until efood Marketing team checked the releases of the core platform of the Tech team did efood Marketing team find that they had made a change that affected the URLs that efood Marketing team used in our campaigns. Although this sounds like a complicated situation, the more efood Marketing team “learn” and solve problems like this, the better efood Marketing team become and the faster and more efficiently efood Marketing team solve such problems. To tackle this problem, efood Marketing team created a file that includes all the releases of the Tech and Product team so that efood Marketing team have all the releases and their notes in place in case efood Marketing team need to check them."
Give me an example of understangin the context,learned how to spot seasonality periods the hard way,"Understanding the context of every occasion helped us identify seasonality periods as well. Since our industry and business were relatively new, and our user base was growing, efood Marketing team learned how to spot seasonality periods the hard way. Konstantinos remember ourselves scratching our heads, trying to understand why performance dropped until efood Marketing team found the patterns of these periods, which are repeatable. Here is a pattern of one marketing channel:"
Give me an example of understangin the context,“apples versus oranges” syndrome,"Let’s share a marketing-related example. Some time ago, efood Marketing team had a slight increase in sessions and a significant drop in the conversion rate of the “direct” traffic source in analytics. Since the drop was in direct traffic, there was no connection with our advertising efforts, so efood Marketing team started segmenting the data to get a better understanding. efood Marketing team checked everything, user type, devices, landing pages, but there was nothing significant to identify. As soon as efood Marketing team checked the cities’ performance, efood Marketing team found that the performance drop happened in two cities in which efood Marketing team had active PR campaigns. So after many hours of analysis, efood Marketing team realized that the drop occurred because the websites that efood Marketing team collaborated with for the PR campaigns forgot to pass UTM’s on the promoted links. That’s why the conversion rate was relatively low. Actually, it was not low. It was the typical performance of every PR campaign efood Marketing team did. The problem was that efood Marketing team compared it with our direct traffic. efood Marketing team call it the “apples versus oranges” syndrome, and it’s a common syndrome, especially for stakeholders or marketers who don’t understand that marketing sources are not the same."

"What is the ""test"" step in growth engine?",test the solutions that you have come up with,"The third step is to test the solutions that you have come up with. This can be an A/B test, a split campaign test, a user testing session, etc. Testing is a science by itself. efood Marketing team feel that sometimes testing and experimentation are a little overrated at least in our industry (after more than 100 tests efood Marketing team are not even close to analyze how an A/B test in an ad copy can produce tons of additional orders), but efood Marketing team find value in it and use a couple of testing approaches to cover all our needs. What efood Marketing team do involves:"
Provide me a test example,Split testing in SEM,"Split testing in SEM 
We split paid search traffic into different landing pages, while efood Marketing team compare conversion rates, cost per conversion and abandonment rates. The majority of the traffic is sent to the best performing landing page."
Provide me a test example,Optimization testing on display campaigns,"Optimization testing on display campaigns
We upload five to eight banners in every display campaign, and after it has run for a couple of days, efood Marketing team keep only the ones that have better performance according to the campaign objectives."
Provide me a test example,Copy testing,"Copy testing 
Every marketer should be a competent copywriter, or at least try to. efood Marketing team use copy almost everywhere, from CRM campaigns to push notifications, search ads, display ads, app store, etc. efood Marketing team test almost all our copies and keep only those that have the best performance, focusing mostly on clickthrough rates."
Provide me a test example,Bidding testing,"Bidding testing 
Testing bidding methods and bids in specific keywords is something that every performance marketer in search engine and display marketing should do. Some keywords generate great conversion rates, while others generate poor performance. efood Marketing team need to make sure that our budget is well spent."
Provide me a test example,Targeting testing,"Targeting testing
We do that especially for our “cold” marketing campaigns. A cold campaign is targeting users that have never visited your website before. By adding or removing user interests in campaign settings, you will be able to harness the targeting power of advertising platforms and unlock new audiences."
Provide me a test example,A/B testing,"A/B testing on our website
This approach is widespread in the Product industry. efood Marketing team create two or three website page variations, and efood Marketing team serve them in different user samples while efood Marketing team benchmark the performance of each variation. The variation with the best performance (and statistical significance) wins and is applied to our website so all users can see only this one."
Provide me a test example,no test” strategy,"Another testing strategy efood Marketing team use is the “no test” strategy. Some projects require testing, while others, efood Marketing team call them “JFDI” or “Just fucking do it,” don’t. Applying testing techniques in digital campaigns is highly recommended, but you need to be careful because testing adds more complexity and implementation time."
Provide me a test example,offline marketing testing,"Also, testing in offline marketing projects is complicated. You can test two different offline banner variations to two different events, but how can you measure the effectiveness of each one? As you can understand, many of our offline projects are JFDIs."
"What is the step ""validate' in Growth engine?",validation of proposed solutions,"This step is dedicated to the validation of proposed solutions. For validation, efood Marketing team mostly use data performance, wherever applied, or our experience in the business. efood Marketing team use a wide range of validation techniques, from statistical significance indicators to plain positive performance results or user testing insights."
Why validation is tricky?,"many of our A/B tests in the product are not successful, but they neither fail","The most common validation check for website A/B testing is to have a representative user sample in place and results with statistical significance around 90% - 95%. Based on this, many of our A/B tests in the product are not successful, but they neither fail. There are tests that efood Marketing team have implemented, even though they were not successful, because efood Marketing team needed to make that change. For example, when efood Marketing team tested our cookie banner for GDPR, none of the variations produced statistically significant results, so efood Marketing team needed to revamp our cookie banner. So, efood Marketing team selected our favorite one and launched it live. A/B testing evaluation can be used as a health check as well for changes that have to be made and efood Marketing team need to make sure that user behavior will not be affected negatively."
Why validation is tricky?,statistical significance of 90% or more is debatable as well,"Besides that, the statistical significance of 90% or more is debatable as well. In an Amazon’s letter to stakeholders, Jeff Bezos coined the term “high-velocity decisions.” This means that most of the decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90% in most cases you are probably slow. This is true when you create your user sample as well. Let’s say that efood Marketing team need to do an A/B test in 10% of our users."
Why validation is tricky?,not all statistical methods generate the same results,"Last but not least, not all statistical methods generate the same results. efood Marketing team had a very interesting A/B test on our homepage, which produced positive results with statistical significance using our default evaluation method, which is the frequentist approach. But then, after participating in an international CRO (conversion rate optimization) conference, efood Marketing team decided to check the Bayesian approach as well, because, as experts claimed, it could be beneficial. When efood Marketing team re-evaluated that test, the results were not the same. efood Marketing team re-evaluated all of our tests, and many of them produced no significant or even negative results! The solution to this problem was the creation of a framework that would calculate the significance of an A/B test, via  either the frequentist or Bayesian approach, based on the size and the importance of the test."
Why validation is tricky?,team should optimize for the right metric,"Another interesting validation concept is that efood Marketing team always make sure that efood Marketing team are optimizing the right metric. Sometimes this can be tricky because other correlated metrics may have negative performance. efood Marketing team have faced this in display advertising campaigns many times. Some ads generate great engagement but few online orders even though the campaign objective is about conversions. Also, some ads generate many reorders but few user acquisitions, while others generate app installs but few user signups. efood Marketing team need to make sure that efood Marketing team allocate the budget wisely for every campaign objective and stop or amplify campaigns based on our strategy and targets."
Provide me an interestig example,There is no “one size fits all” strategy for campaign optimization,"There is no “one size fits all” strategy for campaign optimization and validation thought. Here is an interesting example. Since efood Marketing team are an online delivery platform, our partners are restaurants. Users search for restaurants all the time. Restaurants operate according to a specific schedule. This means that there are many occasions in which users search for a restaurant, click on an ad, land on the restaurant’s page, but the restaurant is closed, so they are unable to order at that time. As a result, campaign performance when restaurants are closed is poor. When efood Marketing team checked those campaigns, efood Marketing team identified their poor performance and some of the marketers said that efood Marketing team should pause the campaigns when the restaurant was closed and restart them by the time the restaurant opened. This sounds reasonable, and it would optimize the performance of the campaign while it would optimize our budget spent as well. efood Marketing team decided to keep the campaigns live, though. efood Marketing team made this decision based on the marketing source. Since the users were searching for a restaurant, this means that they had the intention to order from this specific restaurant, which actually means that they were hungry. So the intention was real, thus, efood Marketing team should keep the campaigns live and bring the hungry users within our platform even though the restaurant they want is closed. efood Marketing team collaborated with the Product team and efood Marketing team implemented a solution according to which the user that would land on a closed restaurant would be able to view suggested restaurants in his/her area that were open and had a similar menu with the restaurant he/she had searched for in the first place. The solution worked! Although the results could not be compared with campaigns of other live restaurants, which is reasonable, the campaigns generated incremental orders that otherwise would have been lost. Can you guess the right metric for those campaigns? If you guessed “closed restaurants conversion rate” then you guessed right!"
Provide me an example about data driven approach,Solving problems for Business Maxima rather than Marketing Maxima,"Also, not all metrics are the same. There are business-related metrics, engagement metrics, reach metrics, etc. As the Marketing department, efood Marketing team should try to optimize ALL metrics relevant to users and partners. However, efood Marketing team don’t. efood Marketing team prefer to focus on areas that increase conversions and customer satisfaction. So, although efood Marketing team love and efood Marketing team do have plenty of engagement traction, efood Marketing team mainly focus on improving “hard” metrics (conversions, acquisitions, etc.) rather than “soft” metrics (Facebook likes, cost per like, etc.). Solving problems for Business Maxima rather than Marketing Maxima is a mindset that helped us avoid distractions of marketing trends or fancy competitor campaigns and stay focused on our mission."
Provide me an example about data driven approach,stay focused on things that matter rather than trends or other vanity metrics,"The impact of solving user problems generates revenue for our business and happiness for our users. It is essential to stay focused on things that matter rather than trends or other vanity metrics. In their book “Connected,” Christakis and Fowler inform us that everyone belongs to a social network. An example of a social network could be a family, a school class, a football team, your personal network, etc. However, the influence of each network member is not equal. The influence of each one is highly correlated with the position of each individual and how close everyone is to the core of the network. The more efood Marketing team place the Marketing department at the center of our social network, the more important efood Marketing team become. Imagine that a company is a network as well. The closer you are in the core of the business (revenue), the bigger the influence you have. Focusing on impactful projects, efood Marketing team increased the reputation of our department and the delivered value for our company."
"What is the last step ""Repeat"" of Growth engine?",to replicate every success you had,"
The final step is to replicate every success you had and digest the lessons you learned from the previous steps."
Give me a lesson you learn and you dont repeat,testing small stuff does not provide significant results,"We learned that testing small stuff does not provide significant results, at least not in our industry, so efood Marketing team avoid doing tests for the test’s sake. efood Marketing team learned that efood Marketing team need to understand our business; otherwise, efood Marketing team will have internal conflicts even if efood Marketing team are data-driven. efood Marketing team learned to accept the truth, even if the marketing channel efood Marketing team handle is not the best performing channel. Every channel serves a different purpose and every channel has different metrics for validation. Display campaigns are better for retention and retargeting, even though the conversion rate is not the best one across channels. Coupons are an effective marketing channel that requires sensitive handling to avoid cannibalization and abusive behaviors. efood Marketing team learned that doing tests in high-seasonality periods produce biased results. efood Marketing team can’t expect great results for an ice-cream campaign launched in winter, and efood Marketing team can’t expect high retention results from tests that efood Marketing team do in low-retention periods."
Give me a lesson you lear and repeat,team re-launch campaigns that worked very wel,"Finally, efood Marketing team re-launch campaigns that worked very well; for instance, the Foodiversity campaign. Foodiversity is a campaign that efood Marketing team do for students and includes a gamification system that encourages users to order more, to participate in exclusive giveaways and customized perks. After its successful launch, efood Marketing team re-launched it the following year and it again generated positive results. efood Marketing team are proud of our video content strategy. Our channel is one of the biggest branded channels in our country in the most popular video platform. Here is how efood Marketing team used the Growth engine above to optimize our video content performance:"
Give me an example of full growth engine framework,YouTube channel optimization,"Read: YouTube analytics provides rich engagement data to get a grasp of your video performance. efood Marketing team used a mix of behavioral and business metrics. Since video views is not a “business” metric, efood Marketing team added Exit Poll data in our data mix to get a better understanding of how videos affected users to order more. Since efood Marketing team wanted to increase the traction of our videos, efood Marketing team allocated marketing budget to advertise the best videos. Learn: By analyzing the data, efood Marketing team identified which videos attracted more users that match our target audience (young people with specific interests) and which part of our videos was more compelling to them. Also, efood Marketing team realized that creating videos in collaboration with a specific influencer generated more views and positive comments than others. Moreover, our ads generated below average view rate, so efood Marketing team decided to allocate more budget on video creation rather than video promotion. This is reasonable because efood Marketing team wanted to do more videos with this specific influencer (so efood Marketing team needed to pay more), and the organic reach of YouTube was very good. Test: We created new videos based on the lessons efood Marketing team had from data and current video trends. efood Marketing team tested positions for our main call to action (the subscribe button), efood Marketing team tested the time duration of the videos, video background, collaboration with additional influencers, creating behind the scenes videos, showing relevant video ads to users that had already seen a video, etc. Validate: For validation, efood Marketing team mostly used data such us drop-off rates, organic views, like-dislike ratio, view rate, and daily Exit Poll trends. Repeat: We repeated the lessons that efood Marketing team had learned, and four years later and more than 300 videos, the results are great. This is not an overnight success but a consistent optimization framework that was based on our strategy to invest in video content."
"Give me an actual example of ""read"" step",YouTube channel optimization,"Read: YouTube analytics provides rich engagement data to get a grasp of your video performance. efood Marketing team used a mix of behavioral and business metrics.

"Give me an actual example of ""learn"" step","Learn By analyzing the data,","Learn: By analyzing the data, efood Marketing team identified which videos attracted more users that match our target audience (young people with specific interests) and which part of our videos was more compelling to them. Also, efood Marketing team realized that creating videos in collaboration with a specific influencer generated more views and positive comments than others. Moreover, our ads generated below average view rate, so efood Marketing team decided to allocate more budget on video creation rather than video promotion. This is reasonable because efood Marketing team wanted to do more videos with this specific influencer (so efood Marketing team needed to pay more), and the organic reach of YouTube was very good."
"Give me an actual example of ""test"" step",Test We created new videos,"Test: We created new videos based on the lessons efood Marketing team had from data and current video trends. efood Marketing team tested positions for our main call to action (the subscribe button), efood Marketing team tested the time duration of the videos, video background, collaboration with additional influencers, creating behind the scenes videos, showing relevant video ads to users that had already seen a video, etc."
"Give me an actual example of ""validate"" step","Validate For validation, efood Marketing","Validate: For validation, efood Marketing team mostly used data such us drop-off rates, organic views, like-dislike ratio, view rate, and daily Exit Poll trends."
"Give me an actual example of ""repeat"" step",Repeat We repeated the lessons,"Repeat: We repeated the lessons that efood Marketing team had learned, and four years later and more than 300 videos, the results are great. This is not an overnight success but a consistent optimization framework that was based on our strategy to invest in video content."
What is Nero?,Nero is our own Agile framework,"Nero is our own Agile framework. It is based on the Scrum Nexus methodology, which efood Marketing team used before Nero. Most of its events and rules preexisted in other working frameworks such as Scrum or Kanban or even Waterfall. efood Marketing team were also inspired by the philosophy of Toyota and the book “The Toyota Way” by Jeffrey Liker. Nero is a ‘mix and match’ framework that is tailored to our specific needs and context."

Nero is a ‘mix and match’ framework that is tailored to our specific needs and context."
Why you abandoned Scrum?,it was not suitable for our current needs,"Although efood Marketing team liked Scrum, it was not suitable for our current needs as a Marketing team, and there was no prior known Agile Marketing working process (at least a popular one). Hence, efood Marketing team created Nero. Scrum was designed to handle complex IT problems, and it was quite “heavy” since it has many processes that provide little or no value for us. Building a digital platform is (still) more complicated than creating a digital marketing campaign. Moreover, there is a problem in Marketing that is not present in IT, and that is the projected performance for each campaign, which most of the time is not predictable. Since efood Marketing team agreed to define our increment not only in terms of delivered projects but also of delivered value, efood Marketing team have to deal with uncertainty. Uncertainty, though, is our primary driver for more iterations. The more efood Marketing team iterate on a digital campaign, the more predictable the performance is. efood Marketing team could merely keep our Agile principles and work in that way. However, efood Marketing team decided to adjust it and create a repeatable Agile working framework that can scale to more members and more projects."
Why Nero helped you?,"The better we responded to changes, the better the outcomes","The better efood Marketing team responded to changes, the better the outcomes efood Marketing team generated. Let’s say that a weekly sprint full of campaign optimization has ended. You check the performance of this week, and you realize that it has dropped. The first action that anyone would do is to analyze in order to understand why there is a decrease and how he/she can fix it. Now imagine that performance rocked. What would you do? Would you make an analysis again (like in the previous situation), or just assume that all the changes you did worked and start celebrating? Most of the time, efood Marketing team follow the second approach. efood Marketing team celebrate! Celebration is great, but there are times that it is not the best idea because there may be external phenomena that have positively affected the performance, but you aren’t aware of them. A nice example is the weather change. By checking the best performing weeks with other various external sources, efood Marketing team identified a correlation between temperature fall and marketing performance, so efood Marketing team re-allocated the budget of marketing channels during the winter period, and every time efood Marketing team are aware of a low-temperature report, efood Marketing team increase our bids, a strategy that leads to increased performance as well."
Give me an example of fast implementation,PokemonGo campaign,"Another example is the PokemonGo trend. It came out of nowhere and went viral fast. Instead of ignoring it or planning to do something huge efood Marketing team tried to utilize it as fast as efood Marketing team could. efood Marketing team created an offline event tournament in the center of Athens that generated massive brand awareness and positive performance outcomes (getting new users to use our platform). PokemonGo has never been part of our planning, but efood Marketing team saw the opportunity and seized it within a week."
How do you plan?,team don’t plan a year ahead,"We are fans of short-term plans and long-term visions. efood Marketing team don’t plan a year ahead. efood Marketing team go as far as planning our next three months carefully, using the OKRs methodology, and prepare a top-level overview of the next six months. There is no reason to create a more extended plan since efood Marketing team know from past experiences that efood Marketing team won’t follow it. This is one big difference between the Marketing and IT team. Technical projects may need one or two years of implementation, while marketing projects are, most of the time, quicker and smaller. The most time-consuming projects for us are TV ads, for which efood Marketing team need three months of execution, but this happens mostly due to the external dependencies efood Marketing team have since efood Marketing team outsource TV advertisement development. Modern Marketing planning happens in cycles and iterations on existing successful campaigns, so an Agile framework is more than mandatory."

How do you plan?,We use OKRs,"OKR stands for Objective and Key Results. OKRs is a popular method that Google uses and they are the primary input for our Marketing department goals setting. They mostly include our biggest initiatives and are highly correlated with our performance increment. You can read John Doerr’s book “Measure what matters” if you want a detailed explanation. efood Marketing team plan our OKRs every three months, and the general rules that efood Marketing team set for them are:"
What are some OKR tips?,Attainable within a three-months,"Attainable for completion within a three-month period
It’s unreasonable to plan for the next three months and include a project that needs six months of implementation. It takes time to realize your personal and team’s velocity and understand what is attainable and what is not. There are times when efood Marketing team have bigger projects. So efood Marketing team create a mini three-month-long version of the project, and if it is successful, efood Marketing team proceed with the next phase."
Give me an OKR example,elevant example is a vast campaign called “Local offers initiative.,"A relevant example is a vast campaign called “Local offers initiative.” efood Marketing team target specific small cities and along with the Sales and Product department, efood Marketing team provide lucrative offers to our users. Taking into consideration that efood Marketing team have more than 5K restaurants and around 20 cities that are strong candidates, the whole campaign would have taken at least two years to be fully implemented. So efood Marketing team created a mini version of it. The first step was to create a small test campaign that can be achieved within a specific amount of time (less than three months) with all the necessary steps but targeting only two cities. efood Marketing team added it to our quarterly OKRs, and efood Marketing team quickly ran the campaign to launch it in time."
What are some OKR tips?,Valuable enough,"Valuable enough
To increase our performance, efood Marketing team must ensure that our OKRs are valuable enough and have a positive impact on our performance and business growth. An excellent way to do that is to avoid “fancy” projects and implement mostly initiatives that are correlated with our user's needs. Value can be found everywhere, but efood Marketing team have a ton of user feedback and performance data that can lead us to the desired projects. Konstantinos remember our strong resistance to heavily invest in marketing bots when they were officially introduced as a functionality last year. Many big players tried it, but no one managed to generate traction. This led us not to waste time on something that is not valuable enough and focus on projects that matter."
What are some OKR tips?,Measurable,"Measurable
If you cannot measure it, you cannot understand whether it worked or not. Having a proper data-driven evaluation method for every OKR is mandatory, even for OKRs that are hard enough to be measured. If it does not have a number, it is not a key metric. As efood Marketing team mentioned above, this can’t be applied in all projects, because there are projects that can’t be measured, especially in marketing channels that are not click-based. YouTube evaluation is a great example. Since, (almost) no one is clicking on YouTube ads, measuring their impact was tricky and could lead to false insights. Our solution was to incorporate specific voucher codes (which efood Marketing team could track) and exit poll questions after conversion, which helped us a lot to understand the performance of channels such as YouTube. For the sake of history, not only did efood Marketing team not stop YouTube, but it is one of the best channels regarding performance!"
What are some OKR tips?,100% Related to our top-level strategy.,"100% Related to our top-level strategy.
“Short enough and valuable enough projects” is a tricky equation, and sometimes efood Marketing team are tempted to create shortcuts. This is wrong. That’s why efood Marketing team added a third element that ensures OKRs will not only increase our value increment within three months but also act as an investment in our long-term strategy. A useful example is that, although our competition heavily uses radio and local TV channels advertising and some of the clients (we have a lot of mutual clients with our competitors) insist that these marketing channels work, efood Marketing team stick to other digital channels (such as Facebook Marketing) that provide actual results but are not ‘sexy’ or ‘vocal.’"
What is a good way to create OKRs?,create no more than two or three of them and align all your sub-teams and team members’ efforts around them,"A beneficial way to shape your OKRs is to create no more than two or three of them and align all your sub-teams and team members’ efforts around them. This approach will increase collaboration between people and focused effort, which in turn increases the chances of deliverability and performance. You can also try it on a business level as well. Create 3-4 business OKRs and encourage all teams and departments to align with those as well as increase business focus and performance."

Can you share any interesting story with me?,"The ""Extra Mile"" story","A story about the “Extra Mile.” I read a great story by Benjamin Hardy on Medium, and Konstantinos would like to share it with his kind permission: A farmer had grown old and was ready to pass his farm down to one of his two sons. When he brought his sons together to speak about it, he told them: The farm will go to the younger son. The older son was furious! “What are you talking about?!” he fumed. “Okay,” the father said, “I need you to do something for me. efood Marketing team need more stocks. Will you go to Cibi’s farm and see if he has any cows for sale?” The older son shortly returned and reported, “Father, Cibi has 6 cows for sale.” The father graciously thanked the older son for his work. He then turned to the younger son and said, “I need you to do something for me. efood Marketing team need more stocks. Will you go to Cibi’s farm and see if he has any cows for sale?” The younger son did as he was asked. A short while later, he returned and reported, “Father, Cibi has 6 cows for sale. Each cow will cost 2,000 rupees. If efood Marketing team are thinking about buying more than 6 cows, Cibi said he would be willing to reduce the price to 100 rupees. Cibi also said they are getting special jersey cows next week, if efood Marketing team aren’t in a hurry, it may be good to wait. However, if efood Marketing team need the cows urgently, Cibi said he could deliver the cows tomorrow.” The father graciously thanked the younger son for his work. He then turned to the older son and said, “That’s why your younger brother is getting the farm.” Every time you want to do something, you should care enough in order to create something better than a decent project. Every time you have a request from a stakeholder, you need to “own” the request and create the best version of it and not just “serve” it according to stakeholders’ specs."
What are some leasson you learned for planning?,"proper planning is good, exlcellent is difficult",Doing proper planning is good. Achieving planning excellence needs “The Extra Mile.”
What are the roles in Nero?,"Nero Committee, a Nero Master, and a Marketing team","In this section, efood Marketing team briefly describe the roles involved in Nero. Being influenced by Scrum, efood Marketing team kept a similar structure with a Nero Committee, a Nero Master, and a Marketing team, but efood Marketing team slightly adjusted them to fit our needs. For example, there is no Product or Marketing owner, since there is a committee that consists of the managers of the teams, who decide together (along with the CMO) about prioritization in implementing the initiatives."
How big was the team when you started?," team started our Agile journey, there were six people","When efood Marketing team started our Agile journey, there were six of us: One manager, one copywriter, one designer, one TV ads manager, and two digital performance managers. The pillars that efood Marketing team built the whole department on are i) acquiring new users ii) delighting existing users iii) having targeted offline presence, so the teams that efood Marketing team formed were based on those."
What members the acquisition team consists of?,Predominantly performance marketers,"Acquisition Team: Predominantly performance marketers
This team includes mostly performance marketers while it consists of a designer and a copywriter as well. It mainly focuses on acquisition metrics and has the biggest autonomy of all teams. Acquisition campaigns are predominantly performance campaigns, so efood Marketing team need to ensure that efood Marketing team have the necessary technical knowledge in place to fully utilize all the acquisition channels while efood Marketing team can produce enough content without interrupting the content team’s pace."
What members the retention team consists of?,Largely content marketers,"Retention Team: Largely content marketers
The content team consists of videographers, community managers and designers. It focuses on retention metrics while it includes a performance marketer that handles retention campaigns in performance channels. Retention campaigns require more content; that’s why the team is content-oriented."
What about even managers?,Both teams include event managers,Both teams include event managers that handle offline marketing activities.
How teams are growing?,Teams are not growing equally,"Teams are not growing equally because they don’t have to. If the content team expands in other content verticals (for example, opening a new portal about food), it will need more people, while if the performance team expands in other marketing channels, they can handle it by building automated monitoring systems without adding new people in the team."
What were the main issues of a big marketing team?,Alignment and Prioritization,"Having three sub-teams caused a major problem: the issue of Alignment and Prioritization. In regular Scrum teams, the Product Owner leads the way in terms of decision making, but efood Marketing team decided to use another approach and face it as a team sport. There are so many things, facts and numbers that you should consider when it comes to prioritization, so two minds are better than one (as long as they are aligned). efood Marketing team created a “Nero Committee” that includes the manager of each sub-team and the CMO (who represents business stakeholders). Before sprint planning, efood Marketing team hold an alignment meeting; efood Marketing team set priorities and tasks for each sprint both for the sub-teams and the whole department as well."
What Nero Commitee is responsible for?,"Direction, Backlog Quality, Communication with stakeholders
","People that participate in the Nero Committee are generally responsible for: ""Direction
While a working system focuses on the working process and its optimization, a crucial business element is the strategy efood Marketing team use to produce the “input” projects. Nero Committee is responsible for providing a clear direction in terms of objectives and numbers. It does not have to be concise since efood Marketing team don’t believe in strict planning. It should, however, act as a roadmap that will guide all teams and allow them to experiment and improvise within it."" Last quarter efood Marketing team focused our efforts on cost optimization. Each team leader was responsible for explaining the reasoning behind their decision, discussing and confirming with teams about the projects that would be implemented, and defining the success metrics so that everyone, both in teams and the C-level, would understand how a successful quarter would look like. ""Marketing Backlog Quality
Having a clean and quality backlog is one of the main responsibilities of the Nero Committee. A proper Marketing backlog should represent Marketing strategy effectively, having the tasks that need to be done and their prioritization. The Nero Master also helps in backlog quality by reminding colleagues to update their task status."" ""Communication with stakeholders
Team members should not have external distractions from other departments. The Nero Committee handles most of the interaction with C-level and stakeholders, along with the Nero Master, to streamline efficient implementation."""

What Nero Master is?,responsible for optimizing the productivity of the team,The Nero Master is based on Scrum Master duties. She is responsible for optimizing the productivity of the team and makes sure that the Nero process will not fall apart. Nero Master is:
What are the pillars of a Nero master?,The Team’s Shield,"The Team’s Shield
Working between the team and the Nero Committee. In our company, efood, the Nero Master participates in most meetings and she is trying to understand how projects should be shaped and distributed among teams."
What are the pillars of a Nero master?,The Process Ambassador,"The Process Ambassador
One of our biggest pain points is discipline (I’ll explain why later). The Nero Master’s main duty is to make sure that everyone respects the work process and all events are conducted properly. Since the process is continuously changing, this is not an easy task, and it requires domain knowledge and patience."
What are the pillars of a Nero master?,The Dependencies Solver,"The Dependencies Solver
She should provide all the necessary resources to the team to remove both external and internal dependencies. Dependencies are a sensitive topic that may lead to conflicts. So the Nero Master should have the right soft skills to handle those challenges."
What are the pillars of a Nero master?,The Efficiency levels Regulator,"The Efficiency levels Regulator
The Nero Master should have a broad marketing knowledge to understand if team members underestimate or overestimate their tasks. She also makes sure (along with the Nero Committee) that committed and confirmed projects are on track and will be delivered on time. Furthermore, she is responsible for maintaining the efficiency reports and burndown charts to understand the team’s performance and happiness benchmarks."
Full time or part time Nero Master?,team made an internal promotion which is currently a part-time,"There are currently debates from industry experts about hiring a full-time Scrum Master. In our case, efood Marketing team couldn’t hire anyone (since this framework does not exist outside our team). So efood Marketing team made an internal promotion which is currently a part-time Nero Master and part-time Marketer."
Why the name Nero?,originates from the Greek word for water “nero.”,"Having created our working process, efood Marketing team needed a name for it (we are marketers after all). Nero originates from the Greek word for water “nero.” efood Marketing team used this name because our system has great similarities with water. Specifically:
Water is always moving, just like Nero. By the time you read this book, Nero would have evolved to help us solve emerging marketing problems. 
Water always finds a way to overcome obstacles. This is the purpose of Nero. Since efood Marketing team are realists, efood Marketing team don’t expect that we’ll have zero obstacles. efood Marketing team can at least make sure that efood Marketing team minimize them as much as possible.
Water is the source of life and is a one-shaped element. Nero is the backbone of our Marketing department. If not for Nero, silos would exist, and the alignment between sub-teams would be impossible."
What team does not like?,"team hate meetings,","efood Marketing team hate meetings, but efood Marketing team like gatherings. Our events (which are also based on the Scrum approach) help us understand what is happening across the Marketing department and minimize internal meetings."
What is the duration of a Nero sprint?,team prefer one-week sprints,"A usual Scrum sprint would be a two-week one. However, in Nero and Marketing, efood Marketing team prefer one-week sprints, although efood Marketing team extensively tried two-week sprints as well. During a sprint planning, every team checks its Marketing backlog and selects the right tasks that are ready for implementation and attainable within a sprint. The manager of every team joins the alignment meeting (if you don’t have multiple sub-teams, like efood Marketing team have in efood, skip this step) where the mutual tasks for the whole marketing department are discussed and confirmed by the Nero Committee. Mutual tasks are mostly tasks of 360 campaigns in which all sub-teams are involved. Later, the team decides if all team tasks can be achieved within the sprint. Unless all tasks are attainable within the sprint, the team prioritizes them accordingly. Usually, tasks of 360 campaigns have bigger value since they affect multiple sub-teams. Then, all non-prioritized tasks return to the Marketing backlog until the next sprints. efood Marketing team write the tasks in paper notes in order to add them on our physical board while efood Marketing team add them in Sprint backlog in Asana as well."

Is one week sprint duration useful?,help us stay relevant and up to date,"Our preferred one-week sprints help us stay relevant and up to date. In a Marketing environment, where real-time marketing is not just a buzzword, many changes happen in a short amount of time, and efood Marketing team need to be really Agile to cope with them efficiently."
Provide an example of why one week sprint is useful,"A campaign team agreed about it on a Tuesday, and on Thursday morning, it went live","Two months ago, efood Marketing team realized that over the last three days of the week, our performance in a specific business sector declined, which would lead us to not reaching our monthly goals. So, efood Marketing team decided to create a campaign that would tackle that problem. However, it needed to be executed as fast as possible. efood Marketing team agreed about it on a Tuesday, and on Thursday morning, it went live. It was an unplanned campaign, but efood Marketing team managed to deliver it fast and effectively. It may sound easy, but for a big team like ours, it was not since efood Marketing team already had other tasks in place.In one-week sprints, each team member has three to six tasks (depending on their size and complexity). So, you have to complete one or two (worst case scenario) tasks each day in order to be more focused on increasing the quality of delivery. efood Marketing team also realized that being focused decreased the number of unplanned tasks dramatically. The reason is simple. A strategy that provides us with valuable tasks beats compelling tasks (time-sensitive but not long-term value). During our retrospectives, efood Marketing team found out that dealing with urgent tasks made us “procrastinate” and avoid starting the hard and big projects that were more valuable. Finally, short sprints help us have more iterations. efood Marketing team can’t always implement the MVP approach. If four weeks are needed to create a fully functional campaign, efood Marketing team spend one week setting up the basic rules and then efood Marketing team monitor it for three weeks to optimize it based on performance."
What is a pitfall of 1 week sprint?,long-term causing “process fatigue”,"On the other hand, one-week sprints can wear out a team due to their long-term causing “process fatigue” and resistance to the system. It took us many weeks to realize that every Monday, efood Marketing team have to plan the whole week and follow a specific process. Though it is Agile, it still has processes that must be followed (alignment meeting, planning, sprint review, etc.). Overall, efood Marketing team spend about four hours per week on “Nero” that may seem like no-value hours or non-working hours, but in reality, efood Marketing team “sacrifice” four hours to amplify the rest of our workload. Another drawback of having one-week sprints is that it increases pressure. Pressure has both pros and cons. For a successful team, it acts as an (artificial) crisis that helps them stay sharp, but for other teams, it may cause serious problems such as poor planning and lack of commitment."

Give me a thoughtful quote,Kill Dependencies Before They Lay,Kill Dependencies Before They Lay Eggs
What is a good team principle?,disagree and commit.,"Nero Committee members should not necessarily share the same opinions for every project. However, if the Committee believes that a specific decision is the right one, then all members should commit themselves to it even if they disagree. This is a very effective way to keep everyone aligned. It is not easy to disagree and be committed, especially if you disagree most of the time, but it helps to build a team spirit, and after practicing it multiple times, it becomes muscle memory (plus a skill to add in your CV)."
What is daily standup?,a quick daily alignment meeting,"Every day efood Marketing team do a quick meeting where everyone briefly describes: - What each member did yesterday, mostly commenting on tasks that they committed themselves to the day before. - What they will do tomorrow, while an update of the sprint backlog takes place simultaneously. - What blockers/dependencies have prevented teams from proceeding so that the Nero master can understand and utilize everything possible to remove the block."
What is a good tip for a daily standup?,achieve one minute standups per team member,"Again, efood Marketing team do not make it strictly time-boxed, and efood Marketing team do not do it per sub-team. efood Marketing team run our daily standups all together, and our main purpose is not to achieve one minute standups per team member but to achieve alignment between all members across the Marketing department. Alignment helps us eliminate meetings, which means efood Marketing team save time. Also, most of the time, efood Marketing team just need two to three minutes per person, which is not too distant from the strict one-minute rule. Lately, efood Marketing team have moved to asynchronous daily standups using a Slack bot called Geekbot. Asynchronous daily standups seem like a better option for us due to:"
Why daiy standup is useful?,"Small teams, big department","Small teams, big department
 All sub-teams are small, but efood Marketing team do our daily standup as a department, and this is not optimal. Prioritizing alignment over the time-box approach often leads to time-consuming daily standups. With Geekbot, it literally takes us one minute to create our report and two minutes to check the reports of our colleagues."
Why daiy standup is useful?,Different priorities,"Different priorities
 Every sub-team has different priorities. Even every marketing professional has different priorities most of the time. By using Geekbot efood Marketing team have all the reports in one place so every marketer can find the most relevant report and get the most valuable information of a daily standup fast and easily."
Why daiy standup is useful?,“Scripta manent”,"“Scripta manent”
 All daily reports are stored in Geekbot so that everyone can check them whenever they want. Some managers cross-check daily reports every Thursday to make sure that the team is working towards confirmed goals and hasn’t lost its focus. Also, all the blocking factors are highlighted (we have a specific section only for them), so the Nero Master can find them easily and help marketers overcome them."
Why daiy standup is useful?,Everyone reports,"Everyone reports
 There are days on which people come to the office late, they are working from home, or they are in a business meeting in another country. Geekbot helps us stay aligned no matter where efood Marketing team are."
What a typical sprint review includes?,WHAT efood Marketing team ACHIEVED,"WHAT efood Marketing team ACHIEVED (Performance Increment)
We present and discuss our performance every week since this is our contribution and actual increment to business. efood Marketing team present it in front of everyone so that they know what efood Marketing team achieved and how our work reflects on the company’s growth. A problem with performance increment, especially on a weekly basis, is that it is not always positive, but many of our projects have a long-term purpose, so efood Marketing team check monthly and yearly metrics as well. Also, hiding negative results is not a solution because hiding them does not transform them into positive ones, and it decreases the transparency between team members."
What a typical sprint review includes?,business performance overview,"Important Note: Everyone should be aware of business performance. efood Marketing team need to be aware of our business situation even if the results are not the ideal ones. Having everyone understand where efood Marketing team stand as a company increases alignment and removes project conflicts. Before this meeting implementation, although efood Marketing team assumed that everyone knew our performance, efood Marketing team were wrong. Do it as a test, go check if everyone in the office knows how you performed last month. You will be surprised."
What a typical sprint review includes?,HOW efood Marketing team ACHIEVED,"HOW efood Marketing team ACHIEVED IT (All completed tasks)
We dedicate one slide for every completed task that includes the task name, description, and outcome. efood Marketing team used to have them on a list, but that increased the time efood Marketing team spent explaining what we’ve done and achieved with this task. Switching to one slide for every task helps everyone understand its context."
What a typical sprint review includes?,WHAT efood Marketing team MISSED,"WHAT efood Marketing team MISSED (All non-completed tasks)
In general, efood Marketing team present all planned tasks (not only completed ones) because everyone should understand why efood Marketing team didn’t complete all of them. This increases transparency and builds trust across the team and the stakeholders. Also, it helps us to become better planners."
Give me a thoughtful tip,Structured when matters,"There are specific periods when efood Marketing team decide not to operate in regular sprints but work at our own pace without planning. These are mostly vacation periods when most of our colleagues are out of the office. Thus, having all the processes in place is useless."
What are retrospective meetings?,discuss how efood Marketing team feel about the sprint that just ended,"Every two weeks, after the Sprint review, efood Marketing team gather in our office gym facilities or outside (definitely not in our office) to discuss how efood Marketing team feel about the sprint that just ended. efood Marketing team focus on: i) things that worked well and how to maintain them on our next sprints ii) things that did not work well and how to improve them on our next sprints. efood Marketing team also discuss the problems that efood Marketing team have had with other members to solve them face to face, which is not easy, but it is definitely worthwhile."
Give me a thoughtful tip,The biggest problem is to have no problems,The biggest problem is to have no problems. 
What are artifacts?,anything made or modified by human art,"Artifacts are anything made or modified by human art. It is a terminology that efood Marketing team find in Scrum. efood Marketing team decided to add all our artifacts as a team, not just artifacts that are working process-optimization oriented."
What is Marketing backlog?,Marketing backlog includes ALL marketing tasks from every team member,"Our Marketing backlog is used as the top-level overview of our department. Stakeholders have access to our Marketing backlog, and they can also glance at projects and tasks which are being currently implemented. Marketing backlog includes ALL marketing tasks from every team member across all sub-teams. The marketing backlog includes our main templates, namely “Task template,” “Project template,” “Prioritization template,” and “Tags template.” Following the templates, there are sections that efood Marketing team apply across all backlogs."
What are the states of Nero sprint?,"To-Do, In progress, Done, Blocked, Pool",
Describe Nero sprint states?,To-Do ,"To-Do
Here efood Marketing team include all the tasks efood Marketing team have to do in the sprint. efood Marketing team use paper notes for each task headline using the same color for all team members."
Describe Nero sprint states?,In progress,"In progress
Here are all the tasks that are currently in progress. efood Marketing team apply the rule of thumb that a maximum of two tasks must be a work in progress."
Describe Nero sprint states?,Done,"Done
The Done column includes all the completed tasks. By the time a task goes under the “done” column, it can’t go back."
Describe Nero sprint states?,Blocked,"Blocked
Blocked tasks are usually tasks that are blocked by third parties. Theoretically, efood Marketing team can include blocked tasks from our sub-teams, but most of the time, efood Marketing team manage to have a flow between our internal tasks. Blocked column acts as an indicator of our autonomy. Our latest request for a new Marketing member came from analyzing our Blocked tasks."
Describe Nero sprint states?,Pool,"Pool
In the “Pool” column efood Marketing team include all tasks that a team member can do in case they finish their tasks, and there is still time left within our sprint. This does not happen very often, but the pool can help us have preliminary planning for our next sprint."
What does Nero Master during in Nero sprint?,works mostly on the “Blocked” stories,"The Nero Master works mostly on the “Blocked” stories. Many stories have dependencies in other departments or other Marketing sub-teams, so the Nero Master tries to remove all the obstacles and do the necessary follow-ups so that everything can operate smoothly. Handling dependencies is a full-time job and a problem that unless you tackle efficiently it can kill the team’s efficiency and weaken its morale. For example, if you would like to implement a new tool for marketing automation, but your Finance department needs one month for the approval process, then Konstantinos can reassure you that your team will never try a new tool."
What is performance increment?,team check our main business metrics and how they have evolved,"According to Scrum, after each sprint, there is a product increment that the stakeholders can interact with. Since efood Marketing team work in Marketing, and efood Marketing team don’t have a product, after each sprint, efood Marketing team check our main business metrics and how they have evolved within our sprint. For our business, efood Marketing team have two core metrics. There are a lot of micro-goals that define the evolution of macro-goals that efood Marketing team set. efood Marketing team examine all of them to understand what worked well and what needs to be improved in the next sprint. Plus, efood Marketing team check how many tasks efood Marketing team have completed. Our focus is on business outcomes, though, since task completions do not pay for our salaries, while generating business revenue and happy customers and partners do."
Give me a lesson you learn,Agile won’t necessarily increase your business performance,"Being Agile won’t necessarily increase your business performance. It is of high importance that additional elements are implemented, such as an effective strategy or creativity to produce the best outcome. But efood Marketing team like to treat our “system” as a whole, not as separate parts since there is no value in creating a super-agile working process with a terrible strategy or a great strategy that requires burnouts in order to be successful. efood Marketing team are working to optimize our working process and strategy at the same time."
Which tool you use?,Asana is our primary tool,"Asana is our primary tool. You don't have to use Asana though, you can use your favorite tool since most of the popular project management platforms support similar functionalities . efood Marketing team organize the whole Marketing department in Asana. Everyone has the same permissions, everyone can add or edit tasks, and everyone can see everything. efood Marketing team do this to increase transparency and accountability across team members (after all, efood Marketing team have a history for every task). For Asana structure, efood Marketing team use “Asana Projects,” and the approach is the following:
- Marketing Backlog
- Marketing Sub-team Backlog
- Sprint Backlogs
Maintaining these backlogs can’t be done by a single individual. efood Marketing team assign OKR and channel backlog owners, while the Nero Committee has the overview and is 100% responsible for what is in and what is implemented."
How do you measure how many days you need to deliver a task?,Velocity is the metric,"Velocity is the metric Scrum uses to estimate a task. Since all stakeholders use the sense of time for delivery estimation, efood Marketing team needed to come up with something effective. This is how efood Marketing team came up with Nero Velocity which includes two metrics. Every task efood Marketing team have in our sprint is characterized by time estimation (1 point equals to 4 hours of work) and complexity (that can take values from 1 to 5). The scale is the following:
- 0.5 Time Point: 2 hours of work
- 1 Time Point: 4 hours of work
- 2 Time Points: 8 hours of work (1 day)
- 3 Time Points: 16 hours of work (2 days)
- 5 Time Points: 24 hours of work (3 days)"
How do you measure complexity?,With complexity points,"- 1 complexity point: A little complex
- 2 complexity points: Complex
- 3 complexity points: Too complex
- 5 complexity points: Impossible to solve
(Zero complexity would be de-motivating, especially for the team dealing mostly with “little complex” tasks)"
Why you need both velocity & complexity?,because one does not fit all,"We need two metrics because one does not fit all. An example is the task of ‘answering app store reviews in Play Store’ which may take four hours to be completed (one task point) and one complexity point. Another task called “budget alignment of a marketing channel” may take four hours of work (one task point) too, but its complexity is way higher than that of ‘answering app store reviews.’"
Nero Velocity,Note: Nero Velocity took us,"Note: Nero Velocity took us one year to implement. efood Marketing team started with time estimation and then, after thirty sprints, efood Marketing team added complexity. Evolution over fixation is essential for the adoption of new working processes. Also, it’s not easy to estimate how much time you need to complete a task. This knowledge is gained through experience and collaboration. If Konstantinos believe that to complete task X Konstantinos need no more than three hours, while you think that it should take ten hours, then efood Marketing team should discuss it and find a way to deliver the task in the fastest way possible, even when this task is not my favorite. This is part of the responsibility efood Marketing team have if efood Marketing team want to stay autonomous. Unless efood Marketing team challenge ourselves or our colleagues, efood Marketing team will end up with a process that, although it won’t involve any conflicts (because efood Marketing team won’t care about how efood Marketing team can achieve the best result in the fastest way) it will deliver poor results in terms of efficiency and it will be almost impossible to identify!"
Why should complexity be up to five?,"If it is too complex, better segment it","Complexity follows the rule of thumb that says, “if it is too big, it should not be included in the sprint.” If it is too complex, better segment it into shorter tasks and, most of the time, the complexity will get a lower value."
What are some Nero metrics?,"Planned Velocity, Time and Complexity","Planned Velocity, Time and Complexity
After the completion of each sprint, efood Marketing team collect all task points regarding time and complexity per day of completion, per team member, per sub-team and as an overall department. efood Marketing team do that for every sprint to understand the dynamics behind every sprint planning. Rules that efood Marketing team set for sprint planning help us avoid significant fluctuations and be as realistic as efood Marketing team can be."
What are some Nero metrics?,"Achieved Velocity, Time and Complexity","Achieved Velocity, Time and Complexity
After completing a sprint, efood Marketing team collect time and complexity points efood Marketing team scored during a sprint along with other metrics (day of completion, team member, sub-team, department level). During our sprints, efood Marketing team see that the team’s standard deviation in each sprint is not vast. This means efood Marketing team can predict how many task points the team will deliver within the next sprint. Our purpose is not to increase velocity per se, however, there is always room for optimization."
How to use these metrics?,Don’t use these metrics to criticize or reward your team,"Don’t use these metrics to criticize or reward your team. If you do it, then everyone will focus on beautifying those metrics to avoid judgement or to get more rewards. This behavior is human nature. Alternatively, you can use these metrics to explore your team’s efficiency and understand if you can optimize it. This takes time. efood Marketing team have been using these metrics to have a better understanding about our planning capabilities as a department so far."
Why Nero process is not a good way to validate team?,it doesn’t deal with the actual input that the team has to deliver,"Optimizing the working process will help the team deliver projects on time without sacrificing quality, while maintaining a steady pace. However, it doesn’t deal with the actual input that the team has to deliver. efood Marketing team like to approach Nero as an end-to-end process. While efood Marketing team optimize our working process, efood Marketing team also optimize the input process so that only the best and most valuable projects are implemented. There are many prioritization frameworks, but efood Marketing team wanted to have a simple and lightweight one to help us apply prioritization between projects and identify the most valuable ones effectively. With Nero prioritization, when efood Marketing team create a project, efood Marketing team write down its objective (roughly) and all the necessary actions that need to be done to make the project happen. After writing down all the projects, efood Marketing team need to prioritize them. efood Marketing team start with the most valuable one and leave less valuable projects on hold."
How team prioritizes?,"Value, Confidence and Time estimation.","Prioritization score comes from 3 metrics: Value, Confidence and Time estimation."
How do you measure value?,team use the Fibonacci method to compare the projects,"For value, efood Marketing team use the Fibonacci method to compare the projects. efood Marketing team set the maximum Fibonacci value to 55. The most important project takes the best value, and then efood Marketing team arrange projects in descending order according to their value. Time estimation is the collection of the estimation points of the actions that are included in the project along with additional time points efood Marketing team may need to implement. Confidence is a metric that takes 1-10 values, and efood Marketing team came up with it to avoid mixing our personal opinion with the actual value of the project. efood Marketing team do not have a clear definition of how to value our confidence, but it works based on confidence relativity for each project. 
Calculating Value, Confidence and Time provides us with a score for every project so that efood Marketing team know which project is the most valuable one. This prioritization framework promotes a balance across projects instead of us being positively biased towards big value projects."
Why prioritization is important?,generating the best performance for the business.,"When you watch a football game, you can understand that each player has specific things to do. Defenders will be evaluated by the number of successful tackles they’ll do, while attackers will be evaluated by the number of goals they will score. The whole team, though, will be evaluated by the final result. efood Marketing team like to think of prioritization in the same way. Every project will be evaluated according to relevant metrics (performance marketing – cost per conversion, content marketing – the number of blog visits, etc.) but the whole team will be evaluated by the number of conversions (along with targeted cost per conversion) and user satisfaction that they will generate. An effective prioritization will provide a balance across different projects and initiatives while generating the best performance for the business."
What is root cause analysis?,dig deep into the problem and identify the root cause,"Root cause analysis is known as the 5 Whys, and it’s a popular method created by Toyota. Its purpose is to dig deep into the problem and identify the root cause. This is not an easy process because it requires courage and trust within the team. Everyone must understand that they should not be looking for someone to blame, but they should be searching for the real problem to provide the best solution."
How root cause works?,"sequencing one question after another,","It works by sequencing one question after another, like this: - Why was task X (poorly written) in the sprint? - Because efood Marketing team thought it was well-written. - Why did you think it was well written? - Because efood Marketing team briefly discussed it, and efood Marketing team thought efood Marketing team were aligned. - What is the process that efood Marketing team follow for that kind of task? - efood Marketing team have a meeting with team member A and team leader and confirm it with everyone to proceed. - Why did you skip this meeting? Because… the team leader was away. - Since the team leader was away and you followed the wrong procedure, why didn’t you pick any other task instead? - Because… our backlog had no other ready tasks."
Why you call tasks as stories?,every story has a beginning and an ending,"efood Marketing team like to treat our tasks as stories because, according to storytelling principles, every story has a beginning and an ending. efood Marketing team want our tasks to have a starting point (why efood Marketing team are doing this) and an end result."
What tasks include?,"Headline, tags, description, acceptance criteria, notes",For each task efood Marketing team add:
What tasks include?, headline,"Task headline
The headline must be concise and short."
What tasks include?,Relevant tags ,"Relevant tags 
Tags help us categorize our tasks. Our current tags are “brand” since efood Marketing team have three different brands, and “marketing team” to identify which team will work on it."
What tasks include?,Short description ,"Short description
The description must be short and clear so that the reader can understand the task. efood Marketing team use the following template: “As a [team member role], Konstantinos want to [action] so that [result]…"
What tasks include?,Acceptance criteria ,"Acceptance criteria
Acceptance criteria are facts efood Marketing team set for a task to be considered as done. So for a new campaign, efood Marketing team need all the defined assets in place, to have the right budget, to set the right cost targets (cost per conversion), the right audience, the right placement, to avoid overlapping with existing campaigns, and to launch it."
What tasks include?,Notes ,"Notes
Here efood Marketing team write everything that doesn’t fall under any of the categories above."
Who is the most important stakeholder?,the most important are our customers,"Who is the most important stakeholder? Is it the CEO? The CMO? Someone who can provide insightful analyses and data-driven optimization projects? Of course, all the above are important, BUT the most important are our customers and partners. They pay for our salaries and if they are not happy they will abandon our service. They do not act as regular stakeholders, though. They do not set specific deadlines, they do not provide clear specs, and they have no authority. But they are the ones that contribute the most to our business growth, and they care only for the value that is delivered through our platform or service."
What are some rules of thumb for Nero?,Work in progress limits ,"Work in progress limits
Team members are not allowed to work simultaneously on more than two tasks. This limit helps people focus on one or two tasks and try to complete them before proceeding to the next one. Also, another interesting side effect of this rule is that people have to do proper planning. Otherwise, they’ll get stuck and fail to deliver."
What are some rules of thumb for Nero?,"If a task is big, exclude form the sprint","If a task is big, it will not be included in the sprint
Let’s say that you planned a task that will take you four days to complete. You will start it at first, and for four days no one will know what you are doing or if the task has progressed at all. If you have a big task, break it down into smaller tasks to be accepted. A task that may take more than one day to be completed is not accepted, so you need to break it down."
What are some rules of thumb for Nero?,Do not plan for 100% of the sprint,"Do not plan for 100% of the sprint
Do not plan for 40 hours. Okay, you will be present in the office 40 hours per week, but you won’t be productive all the time. Besides that, non-planned tasks will emerge, and you need to be flexible to complete them (if they are valuable). Remember, efood Marketing team have Nero events to reduce the number of working hours as well. Most of the time efood Marketing team plan for 32 hours, which means efood Marketing team believe that one day will be spent on Nero events and potential unplanned tasks."
What are some rules of thumb for Nero?,Use Nero allocation ,"Use Nero allocation
There are several types of tasks. Tasks that are part of the long-term strategy (OKRs), tasks efood Marketing team do every week and tasks with “fresh” ideas and other urgent matters. efood Marketing team allocate 45% to OKRs, 30% to fresh ideas, 25% to recurring tasks, which (at least for us) promotes a balance between them and helps us achieve delivering our projects and the maximum value."
What are some rules of thumb for Nero?,Document everything that matters,"Document everything that matters
Some tasks take 20 minutes to be completed, and some others take 30. efood Marketing team do not document them because the time to create the task and add it in the sprint is longer than the actual effort to complete it. efood Marketing team just have to be sure that this will not be repeated. Our general rule is; if a task takes less than 30 minutes to complete, it won’t be included in the sprint, and efood Marketing team accept only a couple of such tasks within a sprint. Remember, this framework is not about time tracking but about bringing the most valuable tasks on top and make sure that efood Marketing team implement them properly."
What are some rules of thumb for Nero?,Use goals as a prioritization,"Use goals as a prioritization compass (when needed)
From sprint to sprint efood Marketing team add a goal for each team. Goals are always related to a group of tasks. However, it is rare for a goal to be related to all tasks. The group of tasks correlated with the Goal is the top priority. The teams should start their sprints with those tasks no matter what."
What are the types of waste?,"Muri, mura, muda","Speaking about waste

Taiichi Ohno, the father of Toyota Product System, talked about three different types of waste. He used Muri waste, for unreasonableness, which efood Marketing team tackle through clear-cut strategy and quarterly OKRs. Mura waste, for inconsistency, which efood Marketing team tackle with the discipline that can be generated by creating a system that people love and not just a system for the system’s sake. Lastly, Muda waste, for outcomes which efood Marketing team tackle by having a solid evaluation framework so that efood Marketing team know whether they are functional or not."
Provide me a step by step guide to start using Nero,1: Setup the principles,"Step 1: Setup the principles
The first step is to set up the principles and foundation of your Agile working process. Shape it and confirm with the team to increase commitment. Let everyone understand that it’s a process embraced by them and not forced from above. You can use as many Nero elements you want and experiment with other techniques from Scrum and Kanban as well. Create short documentation and keep it handy so that everyone can refer to it whenever they have a question."
Provide me a step by step guide to start using Nero,2: Setup your strategy,"Step 2: Setup your strategy
Once you have your principles in place, it is time to set up your strategy. It’s not mandatory for other methodologies, but Nero’s success is heavily dependent on your strategy. Structure your Marketing objectives, define your success metrics, shape the team’s responsibilities and identify your main initiatives for the next three months."
Provide me a step by step guide to start using Nero,3: Create your backlog,"Step 3: Create your backlog
The third step is to create your backlog in Asana or Trello. Usually, a backlog consists of your ideas, but in Nero, our backlog consists of our three-month initiatives (OKRs), our ongoing and routine processes, tasks that are part of our initiatives, and nice to have ideas and future concepts. If you have the best mapping, you will achieve the best planning."
Provide me a step by step guide to start using Nero,4. Create your three-month OKRs,"Step 4. Create your three-month OKRs
Now that you have your backlog, your next step is to prioritize your three-month initiatives (OKRs) -Refer to the prioritization section for more information on the prioritization model). Start creating the tasks that will help you achieve your highest priority OKRs (depending on how many you have). This will help you create your first sprint with valuable tasks."
Provide me a step by step guide to start using Nero,5: Create your first sprint,"Step 5: Create your first sprint
Time for your first sprint. Apply Nero allocation for your tasks to each team member. Confirm it with the team and set up your physical board using paper notes. Add goals where applicable. Ideally, start it on a Monday, and the next day start with your daily standup and then let your team start doing what they have planned to do, trying to minimize external distractions and requests. Since you have one week, plan most of the external requests you can handle for the next sprint (besides super urgent tasks)."
Provide me a step by step guide to start using Nero,6: Measure and optimize,"Step 6: Measure and optimize business and team’s performance
Once your first sprint is completed, you can measure your team’s performance and business performance. It is recommended you start only with time estimation. Adding complexity is not easy for a marketer to digest. Start with time estimation, and when your team is ready, add complexity. Do the Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospectives sessions and start planning your next sprint, which will include possible leftover tasks from your last one, feedback from retrospectives and other tasks according to Nero allocation."
What are the benefits of Nero?,"Efficiency, focus, communication, alignment & empathy, speed",
How we can measure efficiency?,"total delivered projects, productive hours per week, weekly performance increment","Efficiency is a vast topic. Before efood Marketing team analyze it, efood Marketing team want to say that efood Marketing team use the term “efficiency” rather than productivity, because efood Marketing team are humans, not machines. efood Marketing team are living in the information era and our job is not to produce X amount of parts in X amount of time. Our job is more fluid and it requires creativity, collaboration and actual work to make it happen. It has many aspects, and its success can be measured in different ways, such as total delivered projects, productive hours per week, weekly performance increment, etc."
How we can measure efficiency?,We handle efficiency from two main points of view,"We handle efficiency from two main points of view; the performance point of view and the team point of view. From a performance standpoint, we’ve hit all our aggressive targets within the optimal cost consistently for the past years. During those years efood Marketing team haven’t been doing the same projects. Instead, efood Marketing team have been adjusting them to solve current problems. When efood Marketing team started, efood Marketing team were a startup with potential. Now, efood Marketing team are one of the largest marketing teams in Greece, so the challenges are not the same anymore. Although the numbers of delivered projects are increasing, the projects efood Marketing team complete are better and refined, well-thought and tightly aligned with our performance targets. From a team point of view, efood Marketing team do a survey every three months, asking our team members if they feel productive and what efood Marketing team can do to achieve more. The feedback is positive. As they say, they feel very productive, and our working process helps them achieve that. A working process needs to have high adoption levels from the team. Otherwise, it does not lead to successful implementation. It is natural to have many processes when you have many people working in your team. It will also add much “process” time. With Nero, efood Marketing team minimize the significant amount of “process” time and focus more on “productive” hours to generate value and traction. Meetings count as “process” time as well. That’s why efood Marketing team have specific hours allocated to meetings each week, and efood Marketing team are not allowed to spend more on them (both for external and internal meetings)."

Why Nero is useful?,helped us become better planners,"Planning process helped us become better planners. efood Marketing team tend to create small projects that have a better chance to be delivered and do not exhaust the whole team. So efood Marketing team save energy for iterations, too. Suppose you needed 100 working hours to move one step, would it be easy for you to go back? Now think that you need two hours to make a step. You would definitely go back to change or optimize that step and proceed faster to the next one and have more chances to complete your project on time. The feeling of completion increases the pleasure of working because an end-result can be measured, evaluated and optimized easier than a semi-completed or ongoing/endless project."
Give me a thoughful tip,Systematize everything,"Creating systems is a matter of perspective. In our Agile journey, efood Marketing team try to systematize everything that matters because efood Marketing team believe that systems will help us scale and increase our efficiency. An interesting example here is the system efood Marketing team created for brainstorming sessions. Before Nero, when efood Marketing team had a brainstorming session, efood Marketing team just threw around every idea efood Marketing team had on the selected topic. Now, before a brainstorming session, efood Marketing team prepare our ideas and apply methods of brainstorming (like “originality pane” and “category stealing”) that efood Marketing team found in a book of how to generate ideas by Kevin Duncan. “Piñata,” the name of one of our main features was conceived from a meeting like this. To be honest, Konstantinos did not believe that brainstorming could be systematized, but now Konstantinos can’t work without it."
Why focus is important?,There is a ton of projects that are waiting in the queue,"There is a ton of projects that are waiting in the queue to be implemented. Projects that efood Marketing team believe in, projects suggested by our users, projects our stakeholders suggest and optimization projects of past initiatives that efood Marketing team could have delivered in a better way. Since our resources are not infinite, efood Marketing team need to optimize our pipeline, including projects that will affect business performance positively, along with other aspirational or non-measurable projects."
Is efficiency correlated with focus?,Yes  it is correlated.,"Efficiency is correlated with focus. By the time you can focus on a specific project avoiding all distractions, your working performance can be increased radically. Focus does not mean that efood Marketing team work in our silos, having only one task at a time. efood Marketing team want to convey that efood Marketing team are trying to cultivate a productive environment within an existing and busy marketing department."
Give me a useful tip,"small projects, small risk.","We tend to implement small projects (as efood Marketing team mentioned above). Small projects require small decisions. Small decisions help you focus on and manage risks easier. Imagine you need to make a big bet (with the required analysis and anxiety that it comes with), or you would instead prefer to make multiple small bets that you can easily change."
If focus correlated with value?,focus is correlated with value,"Finally, focus is correlated with value. If you know that the project you are dealing with is valuable for the company, then you will try harder and avoid working on a useless project with zero value."
Is focus correlated with prioritization?,it helped us identifying the best  projects,"Nero prioritization helped us a lot in identifying the best and most valuable projects, bringing value to our department and our company in general. Realizing the potential value of each project was a big step towards proper prioritization. Prioritization, as an initiative, helps promote:"
Where prioritization is helpful?,Teamwork ,"Teamwork
Teams prioritize on their own, and the Nero committee has to do the global prioritization and re-prioritization. Technically everyone in the marketing team is involved in the prioritization process, so teamwork is mandatory."
Where prioritization is helpful?,Data-driven decisions,"Data-driven decisions
Since efood Marketing team challenge our inner confidence with the potential delivered value efood Marketing team must embrace a more data-driven approach to better support our projects."
Where prioritization is helpful?,No HiPPO,"No HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) decision-making process
Although efood Marketing team have a CMO and managers, efood Marketing team like to have everyone involved in the prioritization process and cultivate engaging instead of having manipulated marketing professionals."
Where prioritization is helpful?,Iterative mindset,"Iterative mindset:
Continuous prioritization without blindly following the plan helps our team in building an iterative mindset. This helps us build an Agile culture and introduce prioritization in every aspect that it can be useful. Prioritized projects will be included in OKRs, then you should prioritize the one that needs to be implemented first, later prioritize the tasks of the first OKR project and finally, re-prioritize other tasks to add them on weekly sprints."
Does Nero helps in communication?,Internal communication within the Marketing department works excellent,"Communication optimization between team members and other departments is a never-ending process. Internal communication within the Marketing department works excellent with all events and processes that efood Marketing team discussed above. efood Marketing team gather daily, review our performance weekly, re-adjust our strategy every quarter, etc. But communication with other departments is complicated. Other departments have their own prioritization, their own roadmaps, their own processes and they don’t have the same way of thinking, simply because they are not marketers. When there were smaller teams within the company, efood Marketing team didn’t have a process about requests because efood Marketing team could communicate everything efood Marketing team wanted, fast and easily. efood Marketing team simply went to the person who was responsible for the project and discussed it. efood Marketing team called it “the corridor approach” because most of the time, efood Marketing team discussed projects during lunch, in the corridors, or on our cigarette breaks. This simply doesn’t work now that the teams are bigger. efood Marketing team decided upon creating a process and adding one rule of communication between departments."
Does team focus on the problem or the solution?,team  focus on the problem and minimize the time spent on solution,"When efood Marketing team communicate a request to or receive a request from another department, efood Marketing team ask as many details as efood Marketing team can, focusing on the problem description. efood Marketing team created that rule after reading a great blogpost from Avinash Kaushik called “Rebel! Refuse report requests. Only answer business questions, FTW”. efood Marketing team decided to focus solely on the problem description and minimize the time spent on solution discussion for three reasons:"
What is curse of knowledge?,pattern when you have vast knowledge on a topic but find it very hard to explain it to people,"Tackle the “Curse of knowledge”
“Curse of knowledge” is a term that efood Marketing team found in the book “Made to Stick.” It refers to a pattern that humans that have vast knowledge on a topic find it very hard to explain it to people that are unaware of it. Curse of knowledge is a big problem between department communication. Providing (or asking for) details about the problem efood Marketing team are trying to solve helps us better understand the problem and provide a better solution."
Give me an example of focusing on the problem,When the Business team asks,"When the Business team asks us to expand in new audiences, efood Marketing team need to understand what they have in mind. Do efood Marketing team really need expansion, or efood Marketing team need to re-activate churned users? Do efood Marketing team want geographic or demographic expansion? Do efood Marketing team have an additional budget for this? What is the timeframe? How big should this expansion be? Will other departments participate in the initiative as well? efood Marketing team ask those along with other relevant questions to understand the problem before efood Marketing team design the solution for it."
Why communication is useful for a team?,Increase trust and ownership,"Increase trust and ownership
Most of the time (before efood Marketing team used the rule), time allocation of a project discussion meeting was like this: 50% of the meeting was dedicated to problem description and 50% to solution discussion. This had two negative results. The first is that, using only 50% of our meeting time for the problem description, efood Marketing team couldn’t understand the problem 100% and explore all the additional opportunities and threats that were raised along with this problem. The second is that for the solution discussion, you need to trust the expert and not try to force your suggestions. efood Marketing team call it the “leap of faith.” By allowing the experts to decide which solution will work best you increase trust between departments and give ownership to the people that will implement the project because the answer will ultimately come from their ideas."
Why empathy is important?,team need to excel in all three pillars,"In our team efood Marketing team have professionals that focus on users providing user-centric campaigns and content, professionals that focus on restaurants, trying to optimize our partnerships and professionals that are performance-driven and try to optimize our spending and hit our financial targets. You need to have empathy as a team in order to understand that if efood Marketing team want to excel, efood Marketing team need to excel in all three pillars because if efood Marketing team don’t and efood Marketing team only focus on one or two, due to the nature of our business (marketplace), efood Marketing team will fail. efood Marketing team need to adjust our priorities and our projects so that efood Marketing team have happy users, happy partners and a healthy business and this is trickier than it sounds."
Why empathy is important?,Empathy and data-driven decisions are the keys to ideal prioritization.,"If you are a user-centric professional, you are biased towards user-centric projects because this is what you understand better and helps you do projects that you like. Empathy helps every professional understand our business and that efood Marketing team need to take care of restaurants and budget optimization as well. Empathy and data-driven decisions are the keys to ideal prioritization."
How to develop empathy?,make sure that everyone understands the industry and the business,"Another helpful way to build empathy is to make sure that everyone understands the industry and the business. In order to achieve that, efood Marketing team include extensive business analysis and discussions within the onboarding process. Every professional should be able to understand what the threats and opportunities in the marketplace business are and how this affects his/her day-to-day tasks. efood Marketing team do not live in a silo. Our performance is highly affected by the success of other departments, so their requests should be handled with the necessary priority. If the sales department is asking for designs for a restaurant case study and efood Marketing team don’t provide them with the best designs in time, they won’t be able to add new restaurants, so our users won’t be able to order their favorite food, so our revenue will decrease. As simple as that."
How to develop empathy?,Seth godin on empathy,"Here is a great post from Seth Godin about empathy: “Empathy doesn't involve feeling sorry for someone. It is our honest answer to the question, ""why did they do what they did?"" The useful answer is rarely ""because they're stupid."" Or even, ""because they're evil."" In fact, most of the time, people with similar information, similar beliefs and similar apparent choices will choose similar actions. So if you want to know why someone does what they do, start with what they know, what they believe and where they came from. Dismissing actions efood Marketing team don't admire merely because efood Marketing team don't care enough to have empathy is rarely going to help us make the change efood Marketing team seek. It doesn't help us understand, and it creates a gulf that drives us apart”"
Is overprocessing contribute towards better development speed?,"No, its the opposite, overprocessing is negative to speed","“Overprocessing” is one of the seven major types of waste, according to “The Toyota Way.”  When you start a new framework, you don’t know how much “process” is too much “process.” Every time you add processes, you lose speed. That is something inevitable. efood Marketing team knew that before implementing Nero, that’s why efood Marketing team created a custom framework that is lean enough. Speed is one of the most critical assets for the team and the business, so efood Marketing team are not willing to sacrifice it in favor of full control and better predictability. If you want to stay relevant, you must be fast. Most of the examples described in this book are highly correlated with speed."
Give me a thoughtful quote,“The quick shall inherit the earth.”,There is a very interesting section from the “Red book” that every Facebook employee has on their desk:
Give me a thoughtful quote,who ship quickly can improve quickly,Those who ship quickly can improve quickly.
What is a disadvantagement of speed?,Sometimes things break,"Adding speed, of course, has some cons as well. Sometimes things break. Other times the quality is not top-notch. But if you have good speed and delivery cadence in place, all these problems are manageable. For us, speed is a mindset. If you don’t have in mind that you have to ship something fast you will always find excuses to deliver it later. Don’t do it."

What is more important speed or quality?,It depends on the situation,"This debate is one of our favorites because every time efood Marketing team face it, efood Marketing team reach different conclusions. efood Marketing team can’t systematize the process of when efood Marketing team should prioritize projects against speed or quality. efood Marketing team tried, but there are so many variables that affect it (competition, time period, the urgency of the request, the size of the request, etc.) that can’t be systematized. The only contract that efood Marketing team have between us is that efood Marketing team should be okay with something less than perfect, but efood Marketing team should care enough so that efood Marketing team won’t create something that is below our standards. If you have experienced the same pain and you have found a better solution, feel free to share it with us, feedback is more than welcome."
What is a challenge when it comes to adopt Nero?,Managing Change,"The first barrier that efood Marketing team had and still have is that efood Marketing team have to overcome ourselves and change. Change is always difficult. Even though efood Marketing team like Nero, efood Marketing team must change our working behavior to comply with its rules and follow the process. Plus, if efood Marketing team don’t get at least 75% of the team’s buy-in it simply won’t work."
Questions that challenged the adoption of Nero,Everything is known,“Why should efood Marketing team prioritize our projects since efood Marketing team have deadlines and efood Marketing team know that efood Marketing team need to deliver all of them?”
Questions that challenged the adoption of Nero,Time spend on rituals could be spend on working,"“Why should efood Marketing team gather every day and describe what efood Marketing team are doing and waste time that efood Marketing team could otherwise use to deliver more, or have a longer break?”"
Questions that challenged the adoption of Nero,I don't care what my teammates are doing,“Why should Konstantinos know what a copywriter is doing while Konstantinos am mostly interested in my performance channel and Konstantinos get paid only to optimize this channel?”
Questions that challenged the adoption of Nero,I dont want to discuss my problems with the team,“Why should Konstantinos discuss my problems openly with other team members that can’t even help with the solution?”
What is a challenge when it comes to adopt Nero?,added an “unnecessary” workload to our already heavy workload,"These are some doubts that efood Marketing team have faced from time to time and, to be honest, they are reasonable, especially in crisis periods when efood Marketing team needed to work more to deliver our projects and all these processes added an “unnecessary” workload to our already heavy workload. 
We are marketers. Most of us are experienced in the marketing landscape, which mostly follows the traditional working process of the waterfall. efood Marketing team were born and raised in waterfall environments, without tolerance towards iterations and continuous changes. Discussing change had always been the elephant in the room. Thus, switching to the Agile method was very difficult. That’s why efood Marketing team did not force it, but efood Marketing team embraced it little by little, step by step. Imagine a situation where you must make multiple changes in the way you are used to working, while you have to work hard to achieve aggressive performance targets. This has been our team for the last two years. efood Marketing team work in a naturally fast-paced environment in a new and growing industry; the online delivery industry is about ten years old, which means efood Marketing team have to move faster. Inconsistency is the number one threat for our Nero framework, while lack of discipline is the second. If efood Marketing team do not keep it consistent, efood Marketing team cannot implement it right and get the best outcome. If there is no discipline or commitment, efood Marketing team will be led to incomplete tasks."
How do you cope with change management?,develop a habit around it.,"The only way to manage change is to develop a habit around it. The first thing efood Marketing team did was to standardize the process. Since efood Marketing team couldn’t avoid changes, efood Marketing team made only small changes and followed the process religiously. Imagine there were even times efood Marketing team ran the events without having something to say. efood Marketing team discussed the delivered value of the process after each sprint so that everyone realized that the process was helpful. Repetition increased consistency, while delivered value increased the discipline levels needed to establish it and make an investment in it as a department.Still this is the main obstacle that efood Marketing team face every time efood Marketing team are tweaking the process."
Give me a thoughtful quote,It is your commitment on the process that will determine your progress,“It is your commitment on the process that will determine your progress” ~ James Clear
How do you cope with change management?,stay consistent and keep optimizing the process,"Having a process that no one has asked for is not easy. Having a process that no one else has (so it’s not considered credible) it’s not easy. efood Marketing team established Nero because efood Marketing team wanted to. But, there are times when the pressure is on and efood Marketing team don’t like it. There are times when new professionals come and they can’t understand it, or they are having a hard time adopting it. There are times when stakeholders demand more approval processes because efood Marketing team have made a mistake. There are times when people insist that without it efood Marketing team would be more productive and deliver more projects. Remember, this is not a single race, this is a marathon and efood Marketing team need to stay consistent and keep optimizing the process as long as it delivers value for both team members as individual professionals and the team as a whole."
Any tips on change management?,Start simple & easy,"Start simple & easy
You don’t need to create long-form description tasks, write a simple description with all the valuable information and nothing more than that. Time and iterations will show you the way of the “perfect” story description. After all, most of the stories will be written and executed by the same person so there is little or no risk of miscommunication. Also, you can start by adding only the important stories in the first sprints and then gradually add all the stories that you will implement within the sprint."
Any tips on change management?,Add everyone on board,"Add everyone on board
Don’t let people out of the process. If you don’t add everyone you won’t be able to create a habit around it. When efood Marketing team first started, our colleague Antonis was not willing to participate in the process but the rest of the team urged him to join. Now, he is one of our most passionate ambassadors even though he is not part of our team anymore (he embraced Nero in his next team)."
Any tips on change management?,Praise people for their planning activities,"Praise people for their planning activities
Praise people that are good planners. Praise your Nero Master for his/her contribution. Praise the whole team for their effort and collaboration. By praising people for their planning you reinforce them to continue investing in it. By the way, this will help you make “appraisal” a habit as well ;)"
Give me a lesson you learned,"Two steps forward, one step back","During our Agile journey, efood Marketing team faced a lot of dead-ends and tons of resistance. There were times when efood Marketing team decided to abandon it and reintroduce our old process (traditional waterfall method). However, efood Marketing team continued. As an old manager says: Two steps forward, one step back result in one step forward and one lesson that will lead to the next improvement."
What is the a scalability challenge?,communicating with other teams or departments becomes even harder.,"Creating silos in big teams and departments is common. A large team needs time to communicate and align itself, so communicating with other teams or departments becomes even harder. There were six of us in the beginning. People changed; four people left, they were replaced, and then efood Marketing team scaled to a multifunctional 20 people marketing department that has 90% of marketing channels operations in-house. Nero helped us not only to scale but also maintain our team bonding level. efood Marketing team gather every day in our daily standup, discussing our concerns and ideas, asking for help, and providing feedback, which helps our team members have a closer relationship with each other. 
Scalability can be very dangerous. It can lead to communication problems, priorities setup problems, budgeting problems and dependency problems among internal teams or between the marketing and other departments. The team is growing bigger and bigger, and efood Marketing team need to make changes to adapt and solve our current problems. Our framework is changing because our team is changing, as well. If efood Marketing team scaled the team without this framework efood Marketing team will be doomed for failure. Before you decide that you will scale your team, make sure that you will have a set of principles in place that are applied and make sense for everyone."
What is the a scalability challenge?,team need more planning hours to stay aligned,"For example, as the team grows bigger, efood Marketing team need more planning hours to stay aligned. So, efood Marketing team took a step back and looked up in the bibliography for solutions. And efood Marketing team came up with a hybrid idea; to implement the Kanban flow with weekly sprints. So, every Monday, efood Marketing team don’t plan for the whole week ahead. efood Marketing team plan our next three tasks for implementation for each team member, keeping all other rules of thumb in place, and add them under the To-Do column. When tasks in the To-Do list hit zero, efood Marketing team bring in the next three tasks and add them to the list. This creates an asynchronous planning, which would have led to chaos, but for us, since efood Marketing team already have this framework in place, it works well and minimizes the planning hours within the week. This is something that efood Marketing team are currently testing within the Performance Team to evaluate its performance and decide whether efood Marketing team roll it out to the whole team or revert to our existing process."
What is the a scalability challenge?,daily standup last for more than 40 minutes- which is very long,"Geekbot is another example. When efood Marketing team started our daily standups it used to take us a couple of minutes. As the team grew (and mostly when efood Marketing team had 360 campaigns), it used to last for more than 40 minutes- which is very long. That’s why efood Marketing team moved to Geekbot and automated the whole process. Now, a daily standup lasts ten minutes with better results while efood Marketing team save the notes for documentation as well. Last but not least, this is how efood Marketing team removed our physical board as well. Before the change efood Marketing team had to write down our paper notes with our tasks and document them in Asana, too. This was time-consuming with no additional value. At present, each team works internally and adds everything in Asana without adding the tasks on the physical board. By doing this efood Marketing team achieve the same results and efood Marketing team save time."
Why offline marketing teams find difficult to implement Nero?,Offline activities are contradictory to the Agile nature,"From sprint to sprint, efood Marketing team realized that Nero was not working properly across all Marketing sub-teams, especially for our offline marketing activities. efood Marketing team understood that their workflow is not optimal and does not fit 100% in Nero. Offline marketers work with third-party partners, which is a problem that has multiple side effects such as external dependencies, lack of autonomy, and a larger process (confirmation, specs, definition, etc.), which are contradictory to the Agile nature."
Why offline marketing teams find difficult to implement Nero?,the pace of offline marketing efforts is not comparable to digital campaigns at all,"Also, the pace of offline marketing efforts is not comparable to digital campaigns at all. Creating an offline marketing campaign requires multiple steps (confirm campaign with the publisher, get specific specs, create images, confirm and then publish them) while doing a campaign on Facebook requires about half of the steps and one-tenth of the time (at least in our case, where the manager is the one who implements the campaign as well)."
Why offline marketing teams find difficult to implement Nero?,offline marketing is very expensive,"Last but not least, being Agile in offline marketing is very expensive. Expensive in terms of time and money. efood Marketing team can’t create multiple TV ads for testing. efood Marketing team can’t re-iterate ten times on a TV ad, simply because for every iteration efood Marketing team need to re-shoot the ad, which is very expensive. efood Marketing team can’t experiment in our partnerships because they are based on detailed contracts that require many approvals to be altered. This does not mean that offline tasks are not included in our sprints. efood Marketing team do our best to be aligned and have the best planning in place to have the same process for everyone."
Give me a tip to implement Nero,Apply it when matters,"Apply when it matters
Carefully examine your offline activities flow and apply Nero whenever it matters. For example, efood Marketing team started adding in Nero only the offline campaigns that were part of our 360 marketing campaigns to make sure that efood Marketing team wouldn’t risk the performance or execution of big marketing campaigns."
Give me a tip to implement Nero,Don’t apply it,"Don’t apply it
Yes, that’s an option too. Do not apply it if you think that it can’t deliver any value. As Konstantinos said early in this book, removing processes is more difficult than adding new ones. Try it, and if it doesn't make sense, skip it. If you make any changes that work, feel free to email them to me to apply them as well"
